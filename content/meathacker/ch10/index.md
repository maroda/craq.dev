Seth comes to, spitting black sand out of his mouth, scared at first it's dark because his blood has stained the sand. Rising on all fours, it is more clear he has landed in grayish-black-colored sand. Not 15 meters ahead of him is a low, clam-like opening where he can see the bright oranges of a sunset.

He squats like that for a minute, a little dazed, almost not aware of the shouts above until he realizes where he is and rolls upward and to the right just as Lyra slams sideways into the sand from a story above. Scrambling to stand now because they both know what's coming next, Seth backs up on his hands and rises with Lyra's help on his armpit and out of the way. Paisley slides through and lands squarely on his big Biomorph-toed boots, like he just popped out of a Science Center Muscleman Android toy dispenser.

"That was fine until it got steeper." Lyra comments, letting him go and starting towards the narrow opening. The slick rock surface that sent Seth on a spill is an ancient chute for the water that contributed to the features of the stadium cavern, his hunch proves correct. Water stops for very little. They have found a way out.

Seth leans over to rub his thigh. "I also didn't realize we were so far up, the inside of the oasis must have a hill where the temple is sitting. I could have been a little off when I said the entire oasis covered the chamber."

"Mhm, mm. Me first?" Lyra gestures to the lip of the cave and starts forward. Paisley walks up behind Seth and they all bend over to get closer, step by step the space gets narrower and narrower. Soon they are on their hands and knees and then scraping on their bellies to get through the opening. In a few minutes they're out of the cave completely. In the fading sunlight they all look like they've been caked with charcoal and sparkly dust. They laugh at the visage of themselves.

Turning, Lyra is the first to notice the landscape, "There are canyons back here? I... just assumed the oasis was a bubble! Look at them!"

The ripples in the ground look like a mitochondrion cut in half length-wise, but on the scale of about five kilometers, extending north-east into the desert. This is the most life Seth has seen beyond the protective embrace of the oasis, craggy trees lining the strangely slim cut-backs of the canyon walls, flying objects he assumes must be insects feeding at dusk. In the receding sunlight the top of the canyon system glowed as if a molten ribbon was carefully laid on the desert surface.

Lyra breaks the spell once the horizon extinguishes the source of the ribbon's light, "Let's get back before it's too dark, we still have an hour or so of usable light," and turns to walk away from the sunset. Paisley takes up behind her, but not before scooping a sample of black sand.

Seth lingers at the edge of the mitochondrion canyon. This whole area has some connectedness that seems clear at the same time it feels like an unsolvable riddle. He cannot believe the resemblance, and remarks, "This is exactly what I remember from school when we learned about cell mechanics. This looks like it could be a diagram in a book about cell biology..." but the others have started back, and don't hear him.

Jogging a bit to catch up, Seth notices for the first time that Paisley still has the bone shard dangling from a utility belt. The basalt isn't attached, but the way it swings back and forth as they trudge along in soft sand, the whiteness sticking out in the fading daylight, draws a kind of standing wave of a figure eight. He imagines, or sees, the shape expand into a wider circle, wobbling like the circumference has ridges.

Up to their right the canyon rises out of the ground into a large area of rolling hills extending up into the distance. This is the back of the water source. If the bowl inside is arched like a sphere, they're only seeing part of it in the middle. The deeper canyon outside and the diverted water from the middle of a water source pulling from some even deeper aquifer. Unbelievable geologic marvels grouped inside an oasis in the center of a desert that makes you dream.

Ahead, the rising moon silhouettes their camp. From this vantage point it is clearer to see as an eddy of bamboo that outgrew the small undergrowth and pushed its long reaches into the edge of the desert. Seth is wondering if the plants here have dreams, when Lyra breaks the reverie and pauses ahead, "We'll cut to the right and pick up the trail for the rest of this. I don't like how far out our bamboo blind would make us walk into the desert."

With no argument from anyone else, they cut west across knee-high bushes of thick, succulent leaves arranged in brushes and fans. This thickens with a mixture of gnarled oak shrubs and giant blades of grass, taller than they are, that Lyra quickly discovers can saw into her bare skin, and process is slowed significantly.

Tucked into the corner swish of bamboo forest extending to their left, the ground here is a loamy mattress, rich with a species of rock-hugging slime mold or heat resistant fungus or something else that makes it even more difficult to move. Each step is a foot into the middle of a pillow of unknown size and composition, mixing with thicker and thicker upgrowths of bamboo. They are a band of stepping, leaning, pushing, shoving, and kicking their way through an impossible swamp.

Then suddenly as if from a womb of thorns the three emerge, thrashing vegetation and pushing themselves forward, onto the worn trail that extends to the main road to their right. They are at the edge of the jungle, where the harsh environment they just trailblazed meets the tropics that rise congested to the water temple, unseen far above them at the center of the oasis. Which right now might have another new visitor of its own.

The sudden birth from tangled nature to clean pathway lit by the freshly risen moon felt like taking in a breath of clean fresh air. Without speech, the trio turns left to camp.

•••

Beginning from a tip in the jungle and extending along the channel of water that leads to their camp pool, bamboo has legitimately taken over. The path is reduced to a suggestion of a game trail that snakes between the largest tufts of growth.

Daylight is replaced by moonlight, stars begin to appear between the outer wall of bamboo. The exhausted adventurers have no words. Lyra, anxious to get back, is keeping a steady stomping pace. In the near-dark all the bamboo seems to rush in at them. She isn't sure this way is the same path they followed from the pond, but they're going in the right direction, it is still three or four clicks away at least.

In mid-thought about how much time this will take compared to swinging into the Het, Lyra first notices the guys are not rustling behind her.

She stops up short and swings around. The bamboo hides a lot, quickly. It isn't like the images of serene forests with bushido floating through rolling hills of bamboo the width of her forearm. The stuff here is dark mahogany, not green. It grows in tufts that resemble gigantic ponytails, only instead of hair the bamboo grows in bunches: also as wide as her arm, down to straws and reeds, all gathered together in an unmovable clump of twisted roots and new shoots. Lyra is pretty sure she could fire at one and it would stop the bullet.

Pistol drawn, she sees flickering light appear from behind the previous bend of roots and matted grass, and carefully approaches. The light goes out, and on again. Lyra moves slower, closer to the voices that are now recognizable. She straightens, peeks her head around the next thrust of bamboo to see both Seth and Paisley crouched on the ground next to a fallen tree. The light is coming from Paisley, who swings his head up to Lyra with a smile glowing faintly but clearly: CHITIN

Seth remarks, not removing his eyes from the huge cylinder of wood, "it's in here, Paisley, I saw it."

"See what? Should I be concerned?" Lyra clicks open a snap on her hip and holsters her weapon.

Seth drops his head in defeat, explaining as he lifts himself to his feet and turns to Lyra, "It was a roly polly, but it was the biggest one I've ever seen."

"A rolywhatnow?"

"Pill bug? Roly polly?"

"Rolywholyover?" she retorts, shaking her head dramatically. Paisley's aqua light reflects deeply in her violet skin, making her blend into the surrounding reeds. "No sir. Care to be like Paisley here and illuminate us? What's with the CHITIN again?"

Lyra's originally installed vocabulary didn't cover a lot of the stuff people learned in school or grew up with around other children. In some ways she is always an infant when it comes to ways of the world. She liked that Seth didn't let it bug him and he happily explains things. It's when he starts explaining things she knows better that she'd like him to shut the hell up. She is annoyed and wants to get back to rest.

In one motion, Seth turns and explains, "Sorry but I saw it dart into that old rotting bamboo clump and I just wasn't even sure that's the thing I saw," as he heads first down the path, impatient that he lost his chance to catch a critter.

As they walk, Paisley's blue teethlight bouncing around them, Seth explains: "They're spider cousins, arthropods. I've seen small ones in gardens and stuff but they're like the size of peas. This was the size of my hand, and scooted like the wind into that huge section of bamboo. They aren't harmful or poisonous, they eat dead stuff and calcium. It's not that surprising to find them in a tropical oasis, but holy smokes wow that thing was BIG!" he ends in a breathless tone.

"Let me guess, arthropods are made of chit?", synchronizing the last word with swiping a branch out of their way. The bamboo is truly out of control, but now the way they came is 'blazed well enough past here.

Seth laughs, "I am not a biologist, I'm just a nerd who remembers dumb shit. But I think a lot of them do, yeah. Insects and shrimp and any of those centipedes with the crazy horned shells and enormously long legs. They all have it, it's nothing special."

On the final leg of the trail they move more swiftly, silently as the gray-blue of day finally gives way. The full moon is closing in, their time here will be up.
