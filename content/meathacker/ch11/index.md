"He's offline."

Several moments pass. Spyder Dims pulls back in his chair. The room is nondescript. No background on the video, just a blurry corner of a miscellaneous room in some where ever he is today. It is annoying how bad the video is but there doesn't seem to be a good reason.

"Aight den. You seenuh body."

Mr. Jones regards Dims with a stone demeanor. Leaning on the wall, smoking at the window, watching Spyder on his laptop open on the desk. He flips the joint across his mouth, "tied to a wheelchair fell out of a train moving up a bridge onto a cement river. I think he's gone. In that part of LA, stuff like a dead body and good metal don't stick. Lost my good rope too."

"Hmph," his entire body shook with the sigh, Dims replies, "Need to be sure. He got data in dat cracked up head uh his dat ain't nobodys, unduhstan me? Somebody real good can do what dey do with dem dead brains an all. Git."

The video stops and Jones is looking at his own video staring back at him. This mark wasn't supposed to turn into a scavenger hunt, but he owed Dims. So now it is.

Jones slams the laptop closed, scoops it up as he takes a final drag and presses the lit end of the joint into an ornamental bronze ashtray sitting in the center of a coffee table made with fake leather and glass. Not actually faux-leather, but some new design of Mawei that can mold itself into different shapes to hold up solid pieces of tabletop. Its look and feel are all configurable from an app. Because it is Biomorph and very strong, some customers have invented wild combinations. The shape it holds now looks like a hypercube with two sides filled, holding a weirdly shaped, polycarbonate shard he found at a demo site. That thing looks like it could have been a covering for a giant spotlight that split in huge pieces or some sort of –

\<creeeeeeeeeeeeak> from the front foyer in his apartment.

Jones stands mid-thought, grasping his laptop in one hand. He walks to the kitchen bar that looks over his living area, puts his laptop down with a loud "THUNK-AD-DIT" on the marble counter. Keeping the intruder thinking he is unaware, he shuffles loudly around the other end and starts to make himself a drink from the side of the kitchen facing in, away from the room.

He pulls a heavy tumbler with a drawn scraping sound that rings when it tips the edge of the glass shelf. Pulls open the fridge loudly, everything inside shaken and clinking, ducking low to scrape the cup into the ice tray. In the gleam of his bamboo flooring, he can see how the faint color reflections shift slightly as an object moves across the room, blocking light coming in from the hallway.

The ballet that follows might have been choreographed by Merce Cunningham, for two men and a coffee table with a full glass goblet of ice cubes and a split refrigerator door. Jones first kicks the bottom half of the door outward, catching his assailant by the shoe and making them quickly step backward to adjust. This leads to the burglar losing their balance and falling forward on the closing top half of the fridge door, which Jones now ducks under, takes the glassful of frozen water, and shoves up into the masked face. This causes more surprise and shock than cuts and bruising, but ice flies everywhere and the assailant is now falling backward, down three steps to the media area, and down on their elbow with a "SNATPT!" hitting the plexiglass followed by a clumsy fall twisting forward across the table.

Jones with his heldheld behind the fridge already has the Biomorph table app open. In addition to the tesseract program he built out of way too much free time, the software comes with a set of standard furniture shapes. The Biomorph will use the elements given and do its best to create the desired object. The genius of the invention, Jones thought, was how it acted like a fractal vise at a nano level, and would not harm the things it held themselves. So he was fascinated with how a two-shelf coffee table might look in his living area. Chances like this don't come around every day, he had to admit that.

With a swipe the app was open and with two button pushes the Biomorph went to work. The misshapen plexiglass dips down to the side as the material pulls it down to the ground level, away from the human body that it had already grasped tightly to be the top. The man (which his deep voice pleading seemed to indicate) was murmuring "no no no no no, no no no please, no no don't kill me no no no no no no please please please don't kill me no no no"

He does not stop while the Biomorph edges around the corners and threads of his leather spy gear clothing or whatever it was. Jones hates that shit. His brown suits are an artifact from the middle of an old century and he likes how gangster it makes him look. Like a brawny William S Burroughs who enjoys more creative ways than guns to do dirty business. He even liked to read.

Walking around the front of the fake ninja in the full head mask, Jones turns his head to both sides, regarding the pleading man at his knees.

"Mmgonna do some things, Yuhgonna help me decide what. Dig?"

This shuts the criminal up. He lies frozen like he fell, half on a broken arm, half trying to pull himself up.

"Judging by the sound of that fall you need a good splint around that arm. You can have that, I can leave you here, you can heal up and get on your way after we have some conversation. How's that? Cause this is my place. Nobody else's blood but mine falls here."

He looks over the man. The wannabe assassin doesn't have much in the way of weaponry. What was he hoping to do, explode?

"Ah ah ah ah... I'll take that." Jones reaches to the man's free arm, sticking at an angle out of the Biomorph, where a small, silver packet has mysteriously appeared between his fingers. Jones flips it between his own fingers, a thin blister package of what looks like honey.

"STX jelly, nice touch. I think you're not working alone then."

He takes the expensive as hell instant-death pill, walks it over to the tiny bathroom on the side of the bar, throws it into the urinal. The front of the urinal has a signature "R.MUTT", but a different shape than the Duchamp original. Jones likes collecting the bizarre. Without taking his eyes off the burglar, he puts his hand on the flusher paddle, which is sculpted to look like a man's limp penis.

The intruder can see him from this angle and is now breathing very heavily in his cask, sweat is dripping onto the wood floor. Biomorph can't seep into his skin, but it is holding his clothes around him like he is covered in wet towels soaked in concrete. Lucky for him the plexiglass did not extend below the waist.

"Neat handle huh." Jones reaches back to admire it, and cocks his head back at his new struggling coffee table. "Tell you what I'm gonna do. For. You." With each of the last two words, Jones pulls on the silver phallus and the room fills with a flushing water noise. This kid thinks he is some kind of goddamn superhero. He doesn't deserve this, but Jones needs to send a message. Like he always does.

"You're gonna tell Dims that sending his hornets to find anyone is pointless. You people can't sneak up a rabbit's ass with its ears between your tits." Jones shuffles back so the man can see more of him. Mostly he's seeing the ornate bamboo floor, a tight fractal staring back at him under puddles of his sweat. The constriction of the moldable table makes it hard for him to talk, but breathing so far seems OK.

"whuuuut are you dooooing? meeee?"

In one "FLLLLSNPTTAH....WHOSHH", Jones hits another button on the coffee table app, kicks his good lexan treasure into the hall, and hits another button immediately. The Biomorph tingles out into a sphere of spikes, shudders into liquid ripples, loses all color, and snaps back around the man into a transparent mass binding his two arms and torso together like a ninja superhero lollipop.

"Fuck off. And tell Dims to fuck off. If he thinks that motherfucker is still out there, I'll go find him myself. For me. I got things to answer too."

"BUT DUDE! HOW DO I GET THIS OFFA ME?" the shadowy figure complains, too loudly, as he struggles up onto his feet. Jones starts moving towards him, backing him out. The guy is stumbling backward and knocks hard into the door, chains and locks shaking with the force. Thin Man grabs his shoulder and pulls him around as he swings the loose door wide open.

Jones puts on his best Burroughs, he's been working on it. Drawn out, vocal fry on the end of his sentences, he announces to the ruffian: "Congraaaatulations sport! YOU connect the dots... YOU... pick up the pieces... YOU!... you know I can see two tiny pictures of myself... and there's one in each. Of. Your. Eyes."

With struggling and shoving, Jones gets the words out as he manhandles the Biomorph-bound man out of his foyer and into the long stairwell of his dilapidated apartment flats. Nobody but him is in here anymore, this upper ridge was destroyed in wildfires decades before, if you were good you could squat an entire hotel. Easy recipe for him. Screw Dims's measly payouts anyway. Life can be had anywhere, it's hard everywhere. He doesn't need to live it at the whim of a corporate ghetto lord and his sloppy artificial dog-children.

On "Eyes" Jones spins the man around, left hand goes to the sunglasses, right hand pulling his handheld from his back pocket, knee coming up and tipping the top-heavy attacker directly at the stairwell. The "CLININK" of the hardened Biomorph on the balcony railing echoes through the tall well, followed by a moment of stillness, and then right before Sir Ninja Starr and the Biomorph hits the stairway doubling back, Jones disables the table material with a swipe.

The crash and crack of what might be ribs, but maybe legs and wood, is a punctuation as he turns and shuts his front door behind him. In a coda of grinding metal and clicking brackets, the front door is again locked. He returns to his kitchen, picks up the cracked glass, throws it in the sink. The huge shard of what's left of his table is angled against his bedroom door.

Pulling an ancient bottle of Johnny Walker Blue down from his bar, Jones rips the cap off and swings over the top of his real-faux-leather couch, guzzles about a third of the bottle and collapses between seat cushion and floor. Next to him the remains of the table's contents: a pile of fast food trash, magazines, roaches, a small hotel bible, and a full ounce of weed that was sitting there. All now in the carpet.

Thin Man fingers several little buds out of the shag rug. Poor choice in these hot times maybe, but again, time period is what matters here. A sense of interior design that feels a little bit Tarantino and a little bit Mickey Mouse. Shag orange anyway, so at least the pieces of weed stand out. Jones rips a page out of the bible and crumbles the flower into a fold, wrapping and carefully rolling, taking his time. Half on the floor, leg up on the couch, leaning on his elbow.

To nobody, Jones speaks out, "Man that table really brought the room together." He holds up his new creation. It blends with the rising sun, matching the shadows as if it were another skyscraper in the distant downtown. Lighter applied, and a thin trail leaps smokey. He takes a deep drag, waits a second or two, and blows out circles. The tabletop catches a first gleam of morning light and he knows where to go.
