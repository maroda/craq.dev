Dusk is lavender around them as the trio emerges from the bamboo trail. Paisley checks their cluster of big packs, nothing bothered. Lyra throws her satchel down towards the side of the pond and locates a patch of grass to rest. Seth had been limping more on that thigh since the spill down basalt falls.

"Is your leg gonna be alright?"

Seth is massaging his left thigh, running a thumb down the front, watching the muscles move as he stretches his leg.

"I think it will be alright, although I'm not sure it's my leg. This kind of numbness is usually nerve damage somewhere, I might have traumatized a nerve down here someplace." He bends over, indicating his hip and groin area by holding his right hand to his waist, his left continues to rub his upper leg. "My tailbone seems to hurt in certain positions."

"I'm just glad it wasn't any worse." Lyra paused, trying to think of her next question. She needed to know, she had to make sure. There was no way she'll be able to trust Seth with her own truths if she couldn't come to understand his.

"Seth," Lyra waited a beat for him to look at her before she continued, "why did they want to get rid of you? What were you doing at Mawei?"

He understood why she'd ask such a question. They were the enemy. They were designing huge language comprehension and logic systems into artificially intelligent agents, but as a monopoly with highly guarded secrets that sucked all the power out of the world, leaving people starving and entire ecosystems destroyed. How else would a technological giant manage to operate?

"It was reliability, system resilience, performance testing, failure tracking, that kind of thing. When I got on-board, I was asked to perform a gap analysis. There were a lot of gaps. As a result, we submitted paperwork to form a Special Investigative Council on Power InTell, the technology used to run all their systems, including Biomorph. Some newer generative designs were failing at critical energy levels, they needed more capacity with less power. I took it as an opportunity to map where things were across Mawei.

"Everything that the higher ups understood ultimately had to do with demanding more power. I designed a team that would need control over procedures, training, and analysis for all Power InTell. I think someone didn't like this, because we were denied. All the same, over the course of the next nine months a small group of us started coalescing around InTell requirements we were dealing with in our personal work. For me, development platforms and production-ready services, others were dealing with databases, others on user interfaces, some from Biomorph connectivity.

"The demands of what leadership wanted meant geometric power increases in several sections of the architecture. They kept pushing to scale bigger and bigger to contain bigger and bigger models to feed bigger and bigger volumes of user clients. They have begun onboarding high-paying clients, like corporations and governments, that get dedicated white-glove hardware and sometimes specialized data-acquisition outfits.

"Since we were digging into some of the other aspects of InTell when we met informally, we were beginning to uncover more efficient ways of doing things that did not require nearly as much power and scaling. Parts of the system we didn't know about were now more reliable because we successfully decoupled them. This new way of operating used systems-thinking applied to problems where a lot of mechanical process was slowing down integration.

"Part of our frustration was the lack of attention by our management to the real problems we were facing in Power InTell development. Just making things bigger, like increasing power in one section to allow more information from a different section to be processed, causes downstream processes to need more power of their own. Changes cascade to entirely different parts of the system and cause more changes, needing more power. It couldn't go on like this indefinitely. We needed the space to investigate our issues more systematically.

"So at the end of the year, we learn that there is no planned review of InTell incidents, which would provide a lot of insight into how to solve some of these problems. I volunteered to run an interactive retrospective of the year. This helped us show that problems with increasing power can be solved through solutions that design for flexible connectivity and adaptation, not just require infinite scale.

"The new technology leader gave us approval, so we moved forward with the set of actions we built from our large engineering session. We were given the go-ahead to start building the tools and platforms that other InTell engineers could use for development and problem solving. I began giving training, tutoring them on how these newer techniques worked, and facilitating reviews of the failures we hit when Power InTell would not work.

"And data collection. Lots and lots of data. That was the part Mawei leaders liked the most, how can they see the data. Or to put it another way, how can they hold people accountable for not being able to move as fast as they want because Power InTell suffered organizational problems? By demanding we provide the data that hangs us."

The invocation of death brings Seth to stop his litany. He looks into the campfire, takes a long drought from a canteen at his side. Lyra's head rests back on her clasped hands, reclined against a tuft of bamboo and grass. She looks over to him when he stops talking without moving her arms.

"Did something else happen? How did we get from 'savior of fixing this poweringshell' AI thing to throwing you off a moving train?"

Seth looks at her sideways, slouched. The orange light flickers against her bare arms above her head, the darkness making it look something like a stylized ponytail.

"There was something wrong. Is something wrong. Mawei leadership had already been splintered, that new leader of technology had taken over, and now the prior operational leads were missing. The org structure was flattened, positions were removed, accountability erased. Nobody knew what happened. Leaders in my sector started disappearing.

"Like, assassinated disappearing?" Lyra questioned, "Did they get free train rides, too?"

"We... I, well, it wasn't... I don't know. Something mysterious was happening that we could not see. There was one particular group that needed help, we needed to spread the load or the team was going to fail their Power InTell feature. This means educating people, so an official training is announced, right?

"One fucking week before training commences, I am told to stop working on my improvements to the Power InTell system. All of them. The organizational changes and hierarchical control had led to the cancellation of our work. Still, the training I ran was a success, and well-attended. It felt so strange to have so many interested in my help, and yet the organization would not let this new direction happen."

Lyra sits up, elbows on her knees, "What did you do to those assholes?"

Seth laughs. "I did nothing. The work they had me do instead was menial busy-work. I was being put out to pasture, I thought, so I focussed heavily on that work. Just keeping my head down and trying to forget all the improvements we had lined up, still helping the other engineers when I could. Did everything my managers told me to do and contributed to plenty of their ongoing initiatives."

"But then they thew you from a train."

"They tried and failed to throw me from a train." Seth nods in agreement, picks up a handful of sand and throws it at the flames in front of him. They dance a little.

"I still don't know quite how it happened, riding to the south part of the city after I didn't find anyone to meet me on the platform. I was about to leave the car, and then this guy, Thin Man I think someone called him, was there with the wheelchair and a gun, telling me to sit. We wait until a conductor comes through, his uniform doesn't cause any alarm, just like he's helping some handicapped person, his gun sticking me in the side the whole time. I felt turned around and panicking, trying not lose my composure. We start off, but then very shortly after... I don't, it's... something happened with the train... something always happens with the trains, something unexpected, Thin Man fell, I fell, then you found me."

Seth realizes he is sobbing, clasping his numb thigh, rocking back and forth. Lyra has moved beside him, squatting down, and tries to get him to look at her. Lifting his chin with a finger, she calmly intones, "Seth. Take a deep breath with me."

Seth shudders from the grieving, looks up at Lyra and inhales through his nose, letting his belly out and sucking in the cold night air. He looks across the pond and exhales all at once. Lyra places her hand on his shoulder, leans in and kisses the top of his ear, and stands. Seth slumps in a heavy sigh, looking up at the sky in tandem with her standing above him. A partially full moon peeks above the top of the bamboo, pulling behind it a galaxy of stars.
