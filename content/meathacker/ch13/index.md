•••

As tortoise chants go, it isn't bad. Cleric Goferaizai hums the phonemes as he watches the trespassers slide into the dark of the jungle at dusk. The road is wide, they'll find what they're looking for easily enough.

Pace steady in the fading light, always careful about where he steps, Gofer takes the western trails to a nearby cave entrance. These look like elongated smiles along the ground, just enough space for a terrapin his size to crawl between.

Resting there, his eyes scanning the fading shadows for any other movement. Strange combination, these three. Something about it he can't shake. Keeping his gaze open for more anomalies, he allows the full text of the chant to vibrate around him. No other will find the center of the torus until he chants an opening back.

This will give him time.

•••

A low rumble. From behind. Momentary Hibernation upset. Assuming the intrepid travelers have found one of his cat nap spots in their tour of the mound, he perks his head up to get a better angle for his ears.

The sound, the voice, is whispery. A kind of string instrument, modulated by vowels and extremely crisp consonants, low tones as if from the ground:

"g.oooooof.eeeeeeeer.aaaieeeeeeez.aaaieeeeeee"

Gofer slowly intones as he comes to the realization, "Asulus – free?"

"g.oooooood.ooooooo"

"Yes, good. Progress. Perhaps visitors to help."

"g.oooooood.aaaaaaa"

"I rest, torus on. Find you missed. We create again soon."

Deep, dragging steps moved away from him, shoveling regular intervals of dust and gravel descending from the narrow cave opening.

Momentary Hibernation commences.

•••

After a day or so of sleep, the tortoise Cleric feels ready to face another few weeks. His breeding by the Chys had imparted something like eternal life, aided by the regular hibernation. This fugue and meditation turns his aging backward, allowing entropy to self-heal. This is by design, he is a permanent servant leader of the mound, living in recursion.

Moving to the front of the dais is quick from his spot on the west. A nearly straight tunnel path extends from this entrance to an opening beneath an altar within the water temple. Big enough for him, the Humans, but not a full grown Chys like Asulus. His supposition is that these investigators are daytime explorers of the underground, keeping them out of the sun, so he needs to arrive at the temple grounds first.

His front toes slip onto a band of opaque crystal in the tile work. Inlaid just a few inches in front of a brass grate covering a hatch in the side of the altar, the quartz glows momentarily purple, swelling and then back to opalescent nothing. The brass covering folds out from the center, four triangles following its edges, circling in on themselves like a spiral shutter. Just enough room for a large desert tortoise to pass.

Gofer leaves the hatch open, folded back like a giant stapelia blossom. Just in time, it seems. As he moves to the front of the altar, Lyra bounces through the front entrance backwards, talking to the two men behind her.

•••

"Don't get the feeling you've ever visited?" Lyra turns and calls to her companions.

Seth lifts both arms in defiance, "Yesterday and the day before count?"

"No! Of course not! I mean it feels familiar, and I figured that was an effect of the des–"

"Lyra stop."

She drops to her heels, having practically danced backwards through the temple doorway. Their final day of recon and she is itching to learn more about this... magic mound.

When Lyra turns, she can't help but speak it out loud, "magic mound? What!? Is that... the rock from the desert?"

Paisley stands by the door, not sure of what to do. Seth's gait has slowed to almost a tip-toe, edging forward.

Lyra is the closest, hands out to each side. The object looks taller than it did in the dreams. The whole mound is covered in large pyramid-like plates and stands as big as a desk.

"Turtle! The mound! It's a tortoise!" Seth yells from behind, startling her into an imperceptible jump. He stands upright, but before any of them can walk another step, Gofer feels he has tortured them enough. He extends his head, turns towards them, speaking in a scratchy but resonant voice:

"Welcome!!! Humans, you are friends here. Please, follow, if you will."

The three of them are frozen. The small temple is suddenly filled with the hugeness of the reptile. Gofer moves to the open side of the altar and disappears into it.

Exasperated, Seth says, "more crawling, of course there is more crawling."

Lyra is already inside, only her split-toed booted feet sticking out from the altar.

•••

The path here barely fits Paisley's bulk, cheeks emitting an amber glow to help them all follow along. Turning right, he glances down the other direction, where the tunnel widens but stays low. Hearing sounds from there the others aren't perceiving. Imperceptible accents in a winding sinus of passages inside the mound.

Taking a path circling to the right, away from the way back to Gofer's cave, they exit through a squat archway. One by one they emerge and line up: tortoise, synthetic, human, android. Below them is the expanse of the center cavern, shrouded in black except for the small aura of amber light from Paisley. Seth points to the doorway behind them, where iridescent purples illuminate the edges of tiles around the arch, like the grout has come alive.

Not twenty meters along the path from the arch, high contrast sparkles in amber and purple flash back at them. The basalt avalanche and doorway into the arena cave lie ahead. Cleric Goferaizai steps forward and rows of purple bars illuminate the edge of the terrace, disappearing under the pile of rock. With a wave of one leg, a tail wag to one side, the floor of the terrace buckles up. An enormous echo surrounds them as a ton of basalt shards fall against each other, sliding further down the sides.

From the middle of the stone deluge emerges a ramp. Not straight down in a steep diagonal, but a series of dimples pieced together down the edge of each terrace, so that it can be walked casually in a slightly circular descent. Made for something large and squat.

Gofer looks back across his shell at his taller houseguests, "shall we?"

•••

It doesn't take them long to reach the bottom. Slightly more than it took to fall, and much better than the 80km hike down the perimeter. He starts his lecture on the way down. Similar to his hibernation patterns, the Cleric has a habit of producing a long thought, and then allowing silence to permeate the gathering of his next one. His voice, raspy but deep, resonates through his lungspace under the colossal shell. The consonants barely appear on his breath.

"Those who cross the Hetmaikaa will slip into a hypnagogic state. When and where depends. 'Delthup' is what they call it, to come in search of an answer. Some can access their dormant psychedelic pathways, ingesting a cocktail of other substances to help them along and keep them awake. We will see their groups here many times in the winter, like you."

They walk in silence. Some time later:

"However, there are no drugs required here. Alone it is a magical place of sounds and dreams. Howls from the surrounding terrain stirs them. The low hills from nearby canyons shape winds from the mountains into long-range vibrations at very low frequencies, just under a hertz or four. Resonances across Hetmaikaa's irregularly sloping plains grow side bands of theta range, up to seven or eight."

Another pause, where Seth notices the ramp system covers the obsidian tiles, he cannot see his light tags anywhere over the sides. He hurries to keep up when the tortoise speaks again.

"This bubble of half-desert, half-salt is situated here between two ridges to the north and south. Depending on location of the observer, frequencies will excite the low resonances in complex brain function. The effect on most is to dip them into dream states. Interactions with another leads the dreams of both. A film of subconscious capacity can leak into the vibrating air."

With his last words, another more elaborate flip of his tail as he raises the front half of his shell, on two legs, muscular front legs hinging upward. Within seconds, the black forest once far away is now all around them. "Ssshhrrrshhshshthththh" rises thick carbon columns in spirals. As wide as the trees they visited, growing layer by layer, spiraling into bullet shapes, then sides peeling back in triangles like the brass panel in the temple. Large palm-like leaves unfurling.

Goferaizai drops, steady on all fours as some of the bigger gravel rolls his way. None of the area where they stand becomes penetrated, but the side-growth is causing a lot of sand and rock to move around their feet. As quickly as it started, they are engulfed in a forest. Paisley's lights gleam on the spiral patterns. They all look like a faded group in an ancient daguerrotype photo on another planet.

"Please, to the edges while I work," remarks the Cleric. Seth jumps back with hands to each side, looking at his companions edging backwards. As they do, the thicker gravel between them starts to give way to a set of roots or some other kind of creeping vegetation. Gofer begins to hum, the droning broadening into rich formant layers. It sounds like three or four of him, singing in organum.

In front of them lay a grid of vines and branches intertwined and intersected to create 64 identical nests. In each of the living twig bowls stand large shards of milky reticulated quartz, each about the size of a human fist, filtered away from the rest of the chalk. The entire 8x8 structure grows from the ground as a vine, branches routing themselves by some sort of DNA crafting. A slight creaking and twisting of wood for a few short minutes, and finally their form lay as natural as the bamboo outside.

This clumping and redundancy builds up significant amounts of AI/CH. As the Cleric's song loops around a central set of tones, the irregular crystal fists begin to resonate in faint illumination, their amplified vibrations perceptible as a force around them. As the endless looping echoing stacks of voices fill the space, Gofer pauses his song to explain:

"The chaos generator is controlled here. The chanter must be instinctual in disposition and capable of action without hesitation. For centuries, I have canted the stones. Listen."

He moves around to a small statue perched at the corner of the chaos plant, nestled next to its roots and rising with a small dais on top that resembles the water temple garden. As Gofer approaches, a clear liquid fills the grooves in the dais. Placing his clawed foot onto the labyrinth pattern, the liquid sparkles alive, and instantly all 64 stones surge with bright colors. Each one is glowing and changing gradually between eight different tones in different speeds. After a few moments of jagged coordination, the colors merge into a barely stable pattern, wiggling in their squares of roots.

A strange metastable harmony is drifting in the reverberating impulses from every edge of the rock cavern around them, echoing into an energy that shakes more of the basalt shavings into the crevice moat. This balanced vibration gives them all a sense of taking in a deep trance of color and breathing out their souls into each other.

Gofer restarts his throat singing, providing more symbiosis to the aural spell. Then as he lets his voice decrescendo and fade, the muses around them do also.

For the magnificent experience of it all, the Cleric’s face remains stoic. His somber stare peers sleepily at the bush cluster, edged with the pain of something lost. He moves away from the plant and everything goes dark. Paisley's cheeks are somber nightlights of pale pink, standing out in the dark like two bright and wide robotic eyes.

"The Chys are not yet at full working capacity–" starts the tortoise.

Seth can't hold back and interrupts, "Whu, why not? Hey!" as Lyra backhands his shoulder.

After several seconds, Gofer raises his head at Seth and pulls his words together: "There was a city here. You see only the shell of the Chys and some of their descendants in the oasis. The pouring of tokimatalt across the doorway are stone-working tools, used against them in a siege to block the exits and starve the colony."

His gathering pause is accompanied by the long tails of fading echoes.

"The columns and formations in the upper chamber is our collective voice. The Chys carve what is needed. Through their delicate architecture of spirals they funnel the vibration spectra in perpetually rising tones to the chaos plants, and with the right amount of AI/CH produced for the selection of attributes placed in crystal, a new being can be born."

Gofer glances around, his voice has captivated them away from seeing their surroundings fall back into the sand, with only a tiny "WHISSHHHHsshhhhh" and they're gone. Back to the mysterious central forest further in. They all lift their eyes, Paisley gradients the light to a soft purple glow.

"My dear one," the tortoise has turned to Seth, "they cannot, because they are not. I watched you all arrive, at the Gallium Pond." He rotates to Lyra, "do you seek something here, child?"

Lyra has been uncharacteristically quiet. She is staring at the turtle, reaching into a belt pouch, producing the leather box. She carefully opens the box, slowly reaches in, and lifts the bone shard.

"Why do I have this?" Lyra is now intently focussed on Gofer. Like she is trying to read him. "When I found Paise in that broken factory, I couldn't remember anything else... I think I woke up in that factory, all I remember is starting to wander around the huge complex of buildings, large tall white walls, they all looked the same. Except for the burnt out one, except where the explosion–"

Paisley steps forward protectively as Lyra leans in and squats directly in front of Gofer. She is looking at the giant reptile eye-to-eye, hands resting on the gravel, elbows on her knees. The animal's eyes connect deeply with Lyra, they become locked in a gaze, neither of them blink.

It feels like hours, the two combined like this. Still wide-eyed as she steps up and back from Gofer, Lyra holds up the bone again. She looks down as she grips it tightly in her hand. Gofer, low-eyelids gathering that it is time to be moving on, rotates away from Lyra and starts up the scalloped ramp.

"We must unblock. You have done well with the door. Asulus was freed from their prison. They have talked to me. But we must still unblock."

There is no further talking, the trek back is breathless enough. By the time they have emerged in the water temple, the midafternoon shadows are already long across the white dais outside. When they are all clear of the temple, Gofer speaks again:

"Hope rests in clearwater"

A beat of five, and again:

"Speak this to the Rainbow Gypsy. She may be with the ridge group already. The full moon rises tonight."
