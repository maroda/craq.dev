The big lens piece is something Mr Jones found with a few compadres out near the old abandoned air force base north of the city. Like just about everything else out here, when the governments collapsed, the edges of civilization already hanging by a thread began to wither. Many of the Western Alliance were left to fend for themselves, a rising Pacific making new beachfronts and turning everything into rainforest.

Wintertime meant this was the worst, where humid coasts clung to their rain, and the arid air drops down the other side of the mountains. Thus the Mojave exists, now grown even more desolate. During some years El Niño defies physics and traipses across everything in big bursts of Baja slapping typhoons. Some cooler air from the mountains pushes down and catches these storms, typifying monsoons but they happen less and less. Even though it seems like a gradual increase in coastal moisture could create more temperate weather inland, global warming caused the opposite. Rising oceans and thick mountain ranges surrounding LA only caused the rain shadow effect to intensify, areas like Mojave became even drier.

It shows everywhere. Everything he knew before is a skeleton now.

Slithering on a stolen Hooverbee, now through Kramer Junction, just a few hours out of town. Jones had zipped through a few roadblocks, canyon passes included, but the 'bee took the terrain in stride. It wasn't long before he was through the upper elevations and riding the air brakes down the long hill, to an even longer trek up the middle of Death Valley Part Two. All military presence is practically gone, just a few sentrobots in some of the more secret places. So they say.

An hour or so later he is touring up to Red Mountain, where they stumbled on the big broken shard so long ago. He passes some shelters still operating far out to his left, the rows of colorful tent tops hovering on lines of mirage. Humans still survived out here, always did. There is a freedom in the desert that can't be found anywhere. Fed by the expansiveness. Driven by painted skies. Humbled under the curving paisley dots of stars swinging in their long, twisty arm across the planet. Collects folks together.

From this vantage point, he looks across the entire expanse he travelled. To his right, a long and large mountain range looms far away to the north. Now past noon the ridges are gaining a folded-paper looking topology, high-contrast desert cliffs and gorges lifting heavily from the flat desert plain. Ahead of him is the smaller range that cups the endorheic area into a valley. His eyesight at this crisp hour can make out the Koehn Saltruin and the old road into the hills between Red Rocks and Jawbone.

"Well I'm not going to be up here without a joint." Jones announces. There would probably be no other shard here, no use wasting energy to look for anything on his own. The hunk is likely the only surviving nugget of a space station, felled to earth during the Satellites Conflict. It still makes a great coffee table, if he ever goes back.

Pulling a set of pre-rolls out, he flicks the lighter on his glove and takes a few minutes under his broad-brimmed hat to study the expanse laid in front of him. The collection of tents he saw on his way up is nestled like a saddle in a lower portion of the southern ridge. That feels like a mighty fine place to shelter for the night.

Half the joint dangling, he crotches himself back into the 'bee and zips down to ride the southern edge of the lowermost ridge so he can mix into the shadows of the fractal landscape as the sun dips lower. Another handful of hours to get there. Whether he is welcome will be an erosion gully to cross when he slides into it.

•••

The camp from afar is concentric circles that show stages of arrival, rest, and restore. Vehicles like his 'bee spotting like silver and golden bugs parked between large brown beetles of old RVs, tractor trailers hacked together, differently angled 4x4 monstrosities testosteroned out, small plastic scootbrims, and some of the strangest bicycles he's ever seen. Binoculars don't give the auto horror show enough detail to see any faces, but a few dozen people are milling around. Some trucks are still arriving from the south and west.

The pass sits between rises of the small ridge, due south of where the salt and gypsum lake bed starts on the other side. This area gives the gypsy commune a defensive position from any neighboring groups that might want to snatch their good location. There isn't any water here, but in the winter every so often a monsoon will let loose from the west. Jones isn't real sure they would stick around this place through a summer, but he has seen stranger things.

The sprawl of their tents is the secondary line of design. Protect most things circling the wagons, then spread out inside your territory. A few folks are walking back and forth between sets of tents, some of which look like large one-story buildings. There's a lot of big sculpture work around this ring of activity, much of which appears to be made from junk found in the desert. Thin Man digs the aesthetic. There are big flags fluttering around the entire camp, Buddhist symbols and other religious iconography the gypsies reuse for their voodoo.

Closest to the center there is a triangle of space where three dirt roads meet, leaving a large sort of courtyard. To one side of a large boulder is a bank of square objects, connected by bulging wire clumps to a large array of round solar panels spread out in the hills, camouflaged among the desert bushes. Their solar and battery power, nicely laid out too. Around the west side of the boulder set, a framework of risers and stages are built into the earth. There are long desks and platforms on the sides, reaching around to form a large courtyard area. Or dance floor, probably.

Resting his leg on the 'bee, Mr Jones takes a closer look around the horizon. The sun is growing old for the day and in a few hours a moon will rise to light up the sky.

"Liiight up the skaaaieeee" Jones croons, as his scanner settles on a small group joining the party to the north. Two? Three? Dots of black he had not noticed riding in, probably swinging a Delthup before the Gypsy Moon festivities start. Good for them, ain't going for that nonsense. Jones lights another joint.

The final golden tip of Sol pushes beneath the mountainside and brings the first sound to his ears. Sunset before the moon rises is the signal to start the celebration, is his take. He will slip nicely into the crowd of revelers this way, dark dusk shadows soon to be replaced by a silver blanket. Gotta move quickly, appear to be already here. Mr Jones pulls the brim of his hat back, it flips up and snaps together and around almost like a pillbox. His riding attire looks fine, scanner goggles lifted to his forehead, desert leathers and folded body armor he stole from Mawei. With the hat getup, he could be a visiting DJ, or a mummy goth. Or both. Darn, no black lipstick on him.

"But I have the ticket right here!" he whispers joyously, patting the inner pocket under his zipped jacket several times, where the bumps of two dozen pre-rolls sit.

•••

Seth and Paisley are not as excited as Lyra about visiting the gypsy camp. Gofer explained how to drop south and get there by following the wash towards the hillside, not the wash that would put them into the salt flats. They almost missed that turn, but noticed the hazy reflection of colored lights around the edges of a crevice or cliff that ran diagonally away from them to the far left. This easterly move did not seem correct at all, but it was a better option than continuing down the obvious ancient lake shore to their right. And they were losing daylight fast.

"Gofer said that once the sun leaves the desert we'll have a handful of hours before moonrise. He is not precise when he talks," Seth shaking his head in consternation. "Does everyone still feel OK?"

Gofer disabled the torus to allow them all to leave. He can do this from most any place in the oasis, they learned, by chanting a spell. They had until full moonrise at midnight to clear the Hetmaikaa proper, and that meant climbing up the ridge to the pass where they think they collectively see the same lights. Not a single one of them is sure of it. If any residual resonance or low amounts of dreaming stick around, if that is a thing, well they could all be imagining something together.

Lyra begins to sing nonsense:

*Wanting to*
*be worried…*
*salvation lies*
*in moog stabbings*
*and lulliflies?*

Seth and Paisley both do a take to each other and back at Lyra, who is watching their reaction and suddenly bursts out in laughter. She slaps Paisley on the shoulder, "Got you both!" and they laugh together, shuffling up the incline and kicking rocks out of their way, trying to beat the moon to the summit.

"Oh, wait," Seth stops. They are far up the side of the south ridge, near the top of the hillock where they think the pass lies. Without the crunch of their feet on the gravel, sand, and sticks of the desert floor the thud in the ground is unmistakable.

And it repeats. \<OONDUH OONDUH DUH DAOOND DUH DUH DAOOND OONDUH OOND>

They made it. Circling around a large column of rock to their right, the encampment twinkles into view. Like flags and sequins strung up for their arrival. Having no need to sneak up due to their missive from Gofer, the trio triumphantly fan out and walk abreast towards the ramping celebration or ceremony, it is hard to tell which.

The thud-thump of the bass lines and drums must be well toward the middle of the small tent city. When they reach the edge the music still feels muted. Before meeting anyone they wind their way through layers of different vehicles three and four deep. The parked machines fan into the lower parts of the saddle, only the lightest can park up the slopes to each side. The effect is like a bow-tie with a huge center knot, tied with a triangle-shaped center.

Seth notices, "This place looks defensive. See how permanent some of the structures are?" pointing on his left, one side of the extending DJ booth and stage.

Lyra nods, "Can't really tell from here, but I bet that whole structure doubles as a general meeting town square sort of deal."

Paisley, meanwhile, has adorned a rainbow disco-ball style pattern on his face. A grid of squares has engulfed his jaw display, every one a different color, all of them mixed. They are pulsing into smaller squares with trails in the corners, changing the color at random when the smallest, and expanding back out again. All to the beat of the music that is now gaining more loudness the closer they get. And he is practically dance-walking, head bobbing and sessile beard flowing in front of him like a flanging octopus.

They pass several people in this section, through campsites and areas built for congregating. Not many are here however, most are working their way to the center triangle. There are costumes ranging from elaborate frames of LEDs and patches of differently molded materials to long translucent gowns folding around breast to thigh or those who wore no more than paint or jewels on the outlines of their bodies.

Coming from the salt flats in their desert gear, purple metallic round goggles on each of them, hair and skin thick with dirt and sand, they felt acceptable. Those not Paisley wore Paisley-esque half-facepiece jowl armor that provides air filtration, mic and speaker system, interconnected comms with local networks, and connections to most desert survival suits. They look like any of two dozen party goers pulling a retro steam-punk look.

Seth has his googles up and lifts his mask down to his neck, they're starting to feel a bounce to everyone around them. Heads are nodding, feet tapping, a few discrete dance moves from a kid or some alone bloke on the corner. The music is the same muted kind of broken beat, heavy on the mids. He glances to his side and catches Lyra bobbing her head to the trance. Paisley's squares march in golden ratios of the color spectrum.

From the central triangle ahead there comes a sharp "SCHPTKTKTKTTKTKTKKTKTKTK". An enormous sculpture of trash, wood, and collected desert debris sits on the receiving end of a long fuse eating itself across the sand. The distance to one side of the triangle looks like it should have taken a lot longer, so with little warning the jumpy sparks reach the bonfire materials doused in powder accelerant before Seth realizes what is happening.

Kindling becomes flames in an instant burst of light.

Seth collapses.

•••

Mr Jones slides forward on the 'bee, across an east-west ridge towards the gypsies. Keeping close to the taller mountains on his right is feeding him directly into the party. By his own guesstimate, full moon rises just after midnight. The hours before that are superb to grift and relax. Plenty of dark hours to find food, offer a trade for some drugs, get a place to crash.

Humans moving everywhere around a village of tents surrounding the triangle, Jones moves his silvery 'bee to the relative shelter of a tall and dark mound of desert vegetation. From here he can watch the triangle as he hikes the remaining distance, down an easy slope in the saddle of the pass.

There's a ruckus suddenly, as the bonfire ahead is lit, a man drops to the ground on the opposite slope from him. A tinge of recognition. Jones snaps his scanner googles down. The face, it touches a place in his memory. There are people crowding around the man, in a frenzy of dancing. Jones watches as two large humanoids (can't never be sure what is and what ain't) immediately grab the man under his shoulders and drag him out of the din of the central area. Smartly up one side of the saddle and not into more crowds.

Jones decides to find out what's going on. He diverts his entry path, heading due north across a smaller dip and up again on a slope that overlooks the tiny improvised village. He sees the two upright and one unconscious, getting a few meters out and up from the tents. In big strides he pounds through shifting sands and at almost a running pace now speeds over to the mysterious group in the dark.

As he reaches their personal circle of light, he slows down, noting how the light is coming from some sort of flashlight the big one is holding in his mouth. Or two of them, in his mouth? Biotech then probably, some expensive as fuck desert mask.

"Hoe. Lee. Shee. It." Jones manages in a half-voice, stunned at the three worse-for-wear travelers and the unconscious murder victim at their feet.

•••

"Hoe. Lee. Shee. It."

Lyra snaps around. Paisley with her, his cheeklights flaring into high hue bright cyan blue. The stranger holds up both of his arms, covered in a suit not too unlike their own.

"WHO GOES!" Lyra cries.

"Pardon ma'am," the intruder reaches up to pull his travel hat and lightly tips it to Lyra, then to Paisley, then tilts it back down and further back on his bald head. He holds his arms out wide, "nothin to hide here, just here to help."

"How. You don't know us."

"I know that man rightchere," pointing in the dark, the finger of his black gloved hand outlined in cyan wrinkles, at Seth. "And he needs my help. Assassins are searching for him, and right now his braincore is under a cyberattack."

At the word, Lyra steps back, as if Seth magically became contaminated. Paisley shows in his eyes that he isn't sure, but stands his ground next to his fallen comrade. Seth is lying on his side in the sand, slightly shivering, even in his environmental suit. His skin is turning whiter in the rising moonlight.

She looks back up at the Thin Man. "We need him. Please help."

•••

"Please help."

Unmoving, Jones recognizes the opportunity before him. Two roads diverged here, in a yellow saddle of sand. Somewhere far from now he will tell the story of saving the person he was supposed to kill. And how that made all the difference.

With a fury of movement, Jones suddenly rips his desert vest open and pulls out his alchemy bag. Immediately he throws it open on a flat place in the sand and begins pouring different liquids from differently colored vials into a small round jar no larger than his clenched fist. He holds this up in Paisley's rainbow lights, where they swirl about refusing to blend; strands of platinum outline oily stratifications, bright copper ribbons jolt into curvy fractals.

He reaches for a small purple glass jar. Thick and angular glass. Not something mass produced. It has a tiny label on the side in silver print that seems impossibly small:

> Stem Cell Powder. Sprinkle on any superficial wound and heal within 24 hours! Used as a quickening agent for tattoo healing and enables a full heal within 72 hours.

It’s the same thing … reeling over what to do, unsure of anything but that there’s everything. Is there enough time? Has it all gone, what has been wasted up to now and what has been lost? Putting it off until it’s too late? Well when is that? It’s too late or not, right now or not.

He opens the jar and pours the contents into the swirling colors of the glass globe. The powder isn't as fine as he expected, it seems heavy and thick, and immediately sets the liquid a deep sort of blue that glimmers in the full moon rising behind him.

Working on the edge of these slopes is like having a perch on a balcony overlooking an continuously expanding landscape, a curving figure towards infinity. Jones has thought about this place a lot while working in the city. The dying parts are beautiful.

The mixture settles into a mercury-like solution. Jones whips out a tiny telescoping rod with a spoon on the end, no larger than a mil. He dips this into the viscous metallic soup and produces a drop, a bead of a pea, tiny but powerful.

Squatting down, leaning over the man's head, he tears off Seth's goggles and drops the nanoculture into his now-exposed left ear.

•••

Lights exploding traces of magnetism rolls the gravel of a million different hills rushing we don’t stop to notice expurgated lives the exposed and discarded red vinyl covered dining chairs this is a ragged edge, rotation of feral, stainless steel tubing skyward ending in mouths covered like tentacles with darting juices. Iron rock sticks out his arms into the newly chilled morning sun so far away the bird a speck floating down to its killing spot. Steeples surround sprout palmy appendages in spirals piercing outward and building the walls as flesh bruised, taking up pointes to top lines drug out of and melting further down to glass protruding as needles over further earthward below crust below light ripping anchors deep such as to still the sound that vibrates from the people – true ones, filled and rich in mind – who search the graffiti.

Other voices filter the topology away, leaving a sense of what was never there in an eerie scene of being lost. Still, silent, solemn; altitudes unknown by sight soar untethered into the volatile sky. Lengths of listening forgo where sight is left behind, only met again in the rush of rubber kissing concrete. From one monument to another screams the mingled voices until the pleasure of a palm tree rustle feels like deep and inky diesel. By the methods used to integrate us into the Universe, so divorces the two, becoming immeasurable.

*Immeasurable.*

Small strands on end in velvet positions and slightly tingling with vibrations, rustle and straighten by schools queued with drones that swell and outline torus patterns raised in smooth glass and umber tones. Jostling within rhythms obscured but not shaken, relieved as the pulses retreat, strengthened in its own periodicity amplified through an aura of tinted purples and darting between the swollen areola of faraway sunlit fields.

Between the dream luge rises bits of folded paper, thinner by a glance than expected in the air bushed cool by a desert night, danced dotted along the fence loops, jolting and falling graceless tangled in attraction to the sky. In waves by dozens they lift from invisible street-platforms, flailing mothlike into the slumbering eye of the lingering storm, searching for meaning, wafted on nothing but the windcourse and draped across vision all ceased to be on either side of now. Lines of pheromonic language trailed fourteen-legged and scavengeous, morticians in armor over the grounded wings of autumn things. Trapped waterbound in eddies, fluttering final breaths into the gathering stormwind, direct the sound. Listen.

Direct the sound and listen.
Direct the sound and listen.
Direct the sound and listen.
Direct the sound and listen.

•••

Seth opens his eyes slowly, he speaks the words repeating in his head: "Direct the sound and listen."

Lyra half-screams, "SETH!" and drops to his side. Paisley behind helps Seth to sit up straight. He feels comfortable. In the arms of his friends. Safe. Lyra hands him a bottle of water, which he swigs deeply and then looks up to find his killer, standing within arm's reach of them all. Thin Man had followed them to finish him off!

Seth explodes in a shove, a push, and quick kicking of both his legs that does nothing but pushes his ass deeper into the sand. He drops his right hand to his belt and then re-straightens his arm with a click, the switchblade long and gleaming in the moonlight, pointed directly at Thin Man's throat.

"Seth! Seth! Seth! Wait! Stop!" Lyra cries but Seth is huffing, breathing hard, he can't calm down. He drops his hand to his side. He's sweating, out of breath, and glaring at Mr Jones with a look that could convict someone.

"It's OK now," Jones manages to slip into his Burroughs to keep an even demeanor, "we had a baaaad spell together, I recon. But it's Meat Hacker's night tonight."

Seth surges a little forward, but it's weak. He feels so weak. But he also feels like something rotten is gone. Something toxic he did not see. Unable to pull together the strength to even complain, he demands through weak, gritted teeth "What did you do to me?"

The music from below hasn't let up, but now it begins to grow in volume and density. Still muted in style but fanning out in deep, circulating sound. Accompanying drum circles push the celebration to a high pitch. Intricate, unobstructed music that has nowhere to echo, amplified so loud that boulders themselves become bass bins. Groups of painted nude bodies can be seen collecting around the tops of them, like rocks dripped with latex by the moon, heated from the inside. At the central triangle, circles of dancers are now revolving in opposite rows, the more naked of them as close as possible to the enormous blaze of the bonfire. Chilled in shadow, hot to touch on their opposite side.

As the DJ weaves another lattice of sound into the minimalistic construction, they watch together as the halo of yellow-golden-orange light throws a woman's breasts into high contrast as she rips away the flowing silk from her person, tossing it into the flames. She arches up and slowly windmills her arms in opposite directions, slowly, hypnotically, watching her entourage join her in their own erotic beat. These dancers have dropped to squats and slow shuffles to surround her, some reach up to touch her glistening body. Hers is the focus of all attention. Fingers meet briefly. Skin is touching everywhere. She thrives in sweat so close to the flame, dropping her hands between her legs, swiping the moisture across her mons and up to her abdomen, rubbing her nipples in the palms of her hands, chin skyward in ecstasy. Beat change and she is reacting, reaching into the air and prancing with her knees held high, then in a stomping two-step coming down feet spread wide. The hair between her legs curled into individual cyclones of glistening color, magically twisting down in silhouette before the bright central bonfire. Cries are rising around the crowd, pairs joined in the extended climax of the moment. The full moon is directly overhead and bursting with silver.

Jones turns back to the three, amused but not enticed, "Weird? Fun to watch but, think I'll dig at the low tent yon there. The moontribes around here are selective but inviting, easy to check in but you cain't never leave." Thinking another second, he pulls out his clutch of pre-rolls and throws a third of them to the ground between Seth and Lyra.

After the crescendo of events, Lyra is too stunned to make any words happen. She lists to one hip, rests her hands on her belt, and charges Jones:

"You're a Meat Hacker, aren't you."

He stops, shuffles a boot in the silvering sand, looks back in shadow, "No ma'am, but I don't like what Mawei is doing to the motherland here, among other things. So we're in this together, whether I'm one of you or not?" Jones turns his stone gaze at Seth, who cooly nods back.

Lyra plants a diode cluster in front of her and downturns the glow to a warm crimson, "thanks for the weed, but when will you be back? We need to find the Rainbow Gypsy. And none of us are spending the night strung out. We need to recover before we party."

"I'd say you found her," taking off his hat and nodding towards the crowd with a "KLICK" of his tongue. Some are moving to their separate after-parties, but most are still in full tilt dancing, new DJs being swapped every hour. Queen of the Night is still twirling around a twist of bodies to dark psychedelic drops, a shimmering speckled nightingale.

Jones steps over their pile of backpacks and takes off for the chill-room tents. Oddly named as merely escapes, they are well-heated against the cold of the desert at night. The trio's environment suits provide the same protection, they can sleep under the stars if needed. But chances are they can find a chill-room to warm-up and cool down, too. They might be here a while.

Seth watches him skip down the incline, "He knocked out the defect. There was grayness there before, I couldn't think around it. Now I see the dimension of the whole thing," turning back to watch the bonfire dancers, his eyes glued on the voodoo of the glowing woman, "how to unblock the Chys is only the first step."

Seth turns back, gesturing in circles around the group, "We have to find them. Us. The three of us. The four of us. However many it takes. We have to because nobody else will."

"The tortoise told me, through his eyes. I saw my real name. They were so big, full of whatever it is eyes are full of. And the word appeared like it was floating in there, part of the glue. I'm part of that glue. I'm here to help fix it. Bring the pieces together." Her face is tilted away from the moon, looking back in the direction of the Oasis. In the moonlight the angle of her neck and clavicle moves with a glitter effect on the surface of her purple-toned skin, like she holds the constellations. When she looks back to Paisley and Seth, her dirty checks are streaked wet.

Seth nods, reaches down to her hand and clasps it in the sand. Paisley steps across and completes their small triangle, folds his legs into an impossible lotus, and leans his head to one side as he looks over Lyra and Seth. Grabbing one of the Thin Man's pre-rolls off the ground and lighting with one motion, his display swells in soft violet-magenta as he hands the J to Lyra: KITHARA
