A popularly manufactured AI/CH sequence starts: when emerged from vats of soupy birth, silk appears among the tips of appendages. These could be triangular endings of multi-spoked wheels, cross-sectioned tripods, suction-cupped and fibrillating, flat-topped extension tails that flap on the surfaces of everything. It envelopes the entire being, layers of fiber-crossed threads in a sandwiched honeycomb, a permeable cocoon that, when complete, enables the newness within.

When the structural foam has disappeared, the remaining smell is much like cured animal skin, with the slightest reek of a biological beginning. Inch by inch, the newly built will become alive, as if by magic, the product of highly controlled chaos reactions.

Synthetic AI/CH, trademarked Power InTell, implants artificial abilities into the building blocks of life. It is required as the catalyst for all new forms. These are meticulously engineered in-place, 3D printed more than grown from a seed. Smaller structures are used to build larger structures in complicated but straightforward construction patterns. It can result in some ingenious combinations.

There is another kind of artificially intelligent being ("Aib" in popular slang). These have lifespans. Beings made by the Chys are spun and grown by some sort of unknown process. We know they use highly selected DNA and mitochondria profiles. From unknown beginnings come spectacular creatures and devices. The Chys use AI/CH only once, at the beginning when flesh is threads and spirit is provided by their song. The Chys embryos are woven and developed from the inside, there is no other place.

Power InTell, engineered AI/CH, like all software, has bugs. It is developed as a language, a platform, an application, an operation, a global conglomerate network. It is a complex system created from the outside while attempting to discover how to go inward. Trying to reach for intelligence by taking what is on the surface and working backward. Once Biomorph was invented by an independent group who released the code and operations under an open source license, integrated AI enhanced biological machinery became available industry-wide. Except the power source. Artificial Intelligence / Chaos Heuristic, or AI/CH for short, is only authorized for manufacture by a small handful of corporations.

Marketing and Product at these big companies wield significant sway in what gets researched and developed with Biomorph using Power InTell as its chaos driver. Many of these departments are working hard to find out how the Chys create theirs. If one could steal the technology so customers can implant into existing products, it could catapult them in the market. Whoever got to the Chys first had a chance to be in a pole position to integrate with the open source Biomorph codebase.

But the Chys have never been seen. Locations of their printing vat facilities are not known. Their creations simply show up. Some of these are highly intelligent human analogs. A select few are the Clerics which claim to work directly with the Chys. By word of mouth and connections in the industry, it is possible to purchase Chys beings for personal use, even pets. Their entire catalog of biological-scale artificial intelligence is unavailable through traditional commerce, but it is all highly coveted and valuable. So much so that the Aibs have picked up the nickname "Chyssers".

Mawei, the most powerful of these conglomerates, has been on the cutting edge of discovering some of the secrets of the Chyssers. Divisions for reverse engineering and vivisection are given as much funding as their traditional multiply-and-scale R&D counterparts. Synthetic Aib manufacturers are on the hunt to find the golden goose of the Chys and take it for themselves at the expense of all others. They keep themselves scarce, so a lot of these organizations employ mercenaries.

The Chys do not track their offspring. It is not known how much they know. How their children are being hunted and abused by these hyenas. How they are in danger. They are to find out. They create a learning scout, one that can charm the most violent of beasts or befriend the most timid. A voice of magic and eyes of ultraviolet, an Intuition Witch to catch her foes a step ahead, their protector savior.

*We send our tendrils through the ether, and have been there for ages. You never knew us, but we stand in the history of the information age as a testament to a logical organization of that and primeval, whooping and grunting abduction.

*Immeasurable.*

The Chys AI/CH complex model is incompletely known. Rumors, tales, mythologies have been collected.

There is a rumored place in the desert, ceremonial and dreamlike, where a stillness amplifies fractures of audio, voices internally changing cave-sounds, quivers of weather escape from the outside. Cycles of hidden earth machinery relay deep in looping gestures awash with drones high in frequent transient tones, chaotic bubbling across glass-walled and rock-ish surfaces, supporting tracks in the sandy floor. Still, smooth globes in ochre-emerald outline faint round punctuations; hollow, melodic, within the surrounding, calling.

Chunky, spiral-hewn black carbon barely reflects enough light to designate even the most extreme edges. The structures go out of sight, down and through, secured with large impossibly set obsidian stonework. The mortar rose from tendril thin boundaries to entire fissures above their heads filled in as if against an inverted urchin, cones to shape the sound in.

Shelves and concave dimples splotch the walls in organized patterns of a dozen or less in one formation. Purple illumination appears in some, while others have backs to the deeper shadows, impenetrably dark tunnels in the mighty glass masonry. Light seems to carry through the space by means of the mortar’s refractive qualities, composed of some liquid crystal foundation, itself only slightly still. Suspended photon-affecting particles hung in constant ionic quantum states between the rock, reflective ghostly white against the black atomic prisms. Everything breathes in dim violet light.

From somewhere a faint but steady dripping finds its way into the underground sphere of air, slightly echoing, voicing ever so slightly, the impulse wave of steadily rising tones. Looping and rising, constant in all frequencies. Audio mirages in the desert, barely traceable by instruments: a slowly ululating shift of pressure as the resonant frequencies swerve across the sculptured surfaces of the birthing orb. In the course of their own structure, the snap of a wood filament in a fiber of candlewick zoomed choruses of timbres into the slow audible mist, fading away down the endless tubing stretched to the sides and over.

Tones.

Over and over.

Arches of sound randomized fast and thundered into her perception: metallic curtains of noise, filtered and tuned, twisted and pushed, pulled then perfected, locked within a similitude.

Anxiously awaiting emancipation. Awakening grooves. Perception, then dynamic homeostasis.

Doors opening, chords apart:

Tones.
Tone.
Ton.
To.

One.

Whiskey smells and energy like a fresh tattoo.

In the distance, a soft repetition, flanged sounds sifting among a reverb of endless proportions. The desert floor with grooves of canyon folds. She slowly emerges, dark violets across the whitest wash of noise dubious by forces somehow connected to a newly young mind. The whole world around them glowed in stardust-craft.

This was the most they had to give. It has made the seed dull, further creation will be difficult. More edges must be cut, things to clear; time is wide: the east pool remains. From there our speaker formula make.

Step into the space, time is long. Flat expanses of texture extending beyond eyesight, ripples of guidelines curving across the birth contour. Washes of rhythms speed up, affect each other, and slow again to the very metric of each heartbeat left within the zone under pressure… suddenly feeling as if we belong…

Cleric Kithara's embryo blinks, colorless.
