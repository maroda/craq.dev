*POST: L.A.*

*Where grasses*
*once wind-waved,*
*concrete and neon*
*blossom, birthing*
*sunset-washed*
*iron-rich lungfulls,*
*fledgling devoured the sky,*
*fractured imagined neon,*
*flowers to challenge,*
*a desert never thirsts.*

•••

The land here looks like tan wrinkles pulled over tight shapes. There is plenty of large-grain sand, and plenty of chalky white rock gravel to trip on. Overgrown brittlebushes and aster dot the hills.

They pass through the dilapidated old highway, sides and asphalt crumbled in huge sections, falling into the sand. To their right a formidable graveyard of solar panels stretches into the distance. They look like giant broken teeth and computer chips stuck into the earth in all kinds of directions. Beyond the ruins are bigger ruins of wars the trio was not a part of, before any of them emerged from their own chaotic fluid.

Large yucca palms have grown around the abandoned facilities, in the late morning sun they look like lonely, multi-armed attendants waving semaphore flags and talking to each other through their ponytail language.

It should be no more than a full day's hike from Jawbone, and their packs are prepared for the journey. Unlike most travelers who brave the presence of their subconscious at night, they were proceeding in daylight. At night, we expect our dreams to live, we give in to them. During the day, it is a haunting, schizophrenic exercise of pushing forward one step at a time through a barrage of images trying to pull you into imaginary threads of illusion.

Seth stops for a minute, regards the others behind him, looks at the Joshua Trees, and keeps walking down the terminally straight road in the middle of a desert. To him the scene feels so typical of people who walk into the desert to perish, but at least they have sun gear and water supplies, plenty of those protein squares, they'll be fine. Still wonders if he's ready for this.

Once they turn north where the road meets the ridges, a salt flat signals Hetmaikaa's entrance. According to Lyra's information, the oasis will be at "the corner of the dragon's tongue". The ridge looms ahead, the real distance confounded by the extreme flatness of the land.

•••

The old barely paved road simply ends in a disintegration of gravel and rock. Earlier the trio had left Speck in a sheltered area for camp, between two ridges up the canyon, lots of crevices and boulders for cover and camouflage. Here the land has been smoothed and stretched between two ridges stretching down like a dragon's mouth into the flats of the desert. An old lake in an endoheric zone, a salt-dried tongue filling the space between.

He finds a vague path, the erosion from the saline environment destroys everything from the top-down. They know not to go into the mountains, so if they hug the salt flats, they will presumably hit a corner somewhere.

There are some old square poles sticking up, reaching for the blue air of their own woodgrain, worn smooth into frozen fingers. Maybe a building? They walk steadily northward, and whatever seemed like an artery off the east-west expressway of dirt, slowly succumbs to brush and thistles the size of truck tires. Soon they are bushwhacking and blazing their own trail.

*This is how you leave me, grasping helpless along cliffside shelves and shifting plates, she is and like and paper-torn stone borne from a slight volcanic burst.*

"What?" Seth calls from his seat near a weirdly solitary flat rock just ahead. He does not see it begin to move.

Lyra snaps her head up. Not immune. She has to remember that. "I had, I didn't know I drifted, words and figures started to form in front of me, all I could do was read them." Seth probably cannot hear her from up there. "What did you find?"

She looks behind to make sure Paisley hasn't lost them. He ambles a few long steps behind. Hard to tell if he is affected or not.

•••

*He walks. Fingers of consciousness lift into a mass of wire borne impulses, sweeping the full range. The combination of these places, the representation of sentience, combine external to the biological self. A sense that tendrils reach through multifarious vector places, morphologically diverse, extending bulbous through time and location, a measure of mere bits delivered. Through data is a perceived conception, the natural extension of the psyche into a world-mind, inherently capable of calculations made possible by an endless stream of information, calculated but varied, grouping as leaves in swirl by eddies wind.*

"Paise? Paise are you OK back there?" flanges through the air in front of Paisley. He has never... thoughted since then. Thunk? Thanked or thinkered. He looks up, still walking, waves at Lyra. She turns and continues toward Seth.

*Unconscious mind, developed like consciousness, would be similarly complex and perform computations without us knowing.*

*He forwards his thinking with each step.*

•••

A few minutes later Lyra has reached Seth, who is reciting a poem, standing by this lone mound of rock on the side of a salt desert in the afternoon sun, watching the mountains behind them and to the south.

*Prefer the stone*
*as perfect still*
*slips silent away to death*

*Sinking rock*
*is better caught*
*as rough its edges felt*

*Parabolic figures*
*whisper breath*
*and bindings melt*

*Diagonal wisp*
*into the gradient sky:*
*Green mounds buttressed* 
*a melting blue gray hue.*

*Colors of Los Angeles* 
*bleed softly heartward*
*mixing down the palette*
*as a golden sun.*

Seth slowly recognizes his friends walking towards him. Friends. They are blurry, like mirages, wavy suggestions against the hillside. But then the closer they come, the sharper they are. It is Lyra the Magnificent, she walks up to him perfectly. She seems as solid as a column of air, but the sound from her lips is certain as she sings:

*They killed a tree today on Beverly, its arms fed the chipper jaws*
*Where do the pieces go, freed from modern paws?

*To make way for viewing six feet of cleavage,*
*the towering gleam of lamé curves hoisted.

*Never again to suffer from the collection of cars
imparting exhaust and street-dust in cloisters.*

*Deep green wavy leaves no longer swagger in dawn*
*of surrogate banisters flinging sauces to yearn.*

The instant of music. Like an evolving plane, where the closer our energy is to the front line, the more engaged our intuition; it enhances our sense of adaptability to the speed of existence. Inherent personality is laid raw here, outward facing as if stripped of skin, a gruesome yet fascinating view of immediately visceral creativity.

The movement becomes a series of eventualities perched hawk-like in view of all influence, spurred by the moment to take flight in any direction, with cognizance in unconsciousness. These are no more choice than influential suggestions, capable of turn-screw solutions in the fraction of form. Lyra continues:

*Sightings shimmer the way* 
*moonlight hunts the shoreline*

*Sounding out each ending*
*smoothly infinite across the touch*

*In light, in ubiquity, in resonance;
reflected shades absorbed*

*Fondle shapes glimmer shadow
hinted surfaces responding to curve.

Seth watches Lyra's statuesque pose as she sings, an ebony figurine against the white fluffy stage dusting up behind them, and when she is finished he answers: "These are our true voices! These are signals to Sun Ra, calls for help to the magnificence of Saturn, come save our fate! Layers pinged out and looped through, sifted into each other and shuffled along fractally whistling fifty progressions in organum, solidly resonant firmament of filtered noise!"

Lyra silently moves again, Seth follows.

Their pet rock crawls slowly to the east, stopping to crunch on a low-lying cactus with big fleshy leaves that look like commas.

•••

Paisley guards.

*To him, technology is jazz improv; in order to succeed, you must internalize and begin to think how the system thinks, adjust to the continuing behavior. It all involves a complex balance of adaptation and sustenance. Riding the normalized figures of known quantities is not enough, there is a necessity in reconfiguration and expansion through creative design. That we must build our intuition together.*

The sun flares higher skyward, beaming thistles away to tumble.

•••

Seth, walking furtively along a crusty salt edge, minerals of toxic insulation blossom in fractals of cauliflower slices marking the ground with crystals, he chants in organum:

*The artist is like a cactus.*
*When cut back,*
*resources diminished,*
*forced to grow,*
*fruit in surprising places.*

He spins, Lyra and Paisley behind him look as if they were toys, set onto a dusty table, with peaks of paper-maiche rising around them. He feels the need to explain: "We work towards being who we are. The instinct to just be different, to do something because no one else is. The reason for that is connected to our desire to search for the truth in ourselves."

"You’re looking for what?" she asks.

"A reason for words."

Lyra looks squarely in Seth's eyes, but it is as if she is looking beyond him with opals between her eyelids. The centers swirl. “Won’t find that here. The poem exists in time as music or theatre, a necessary facet of our entire experience at that moment; as we comprehend its language, encapsulate and translate semiotic tones, feed meaning into our always running sensory system and processing units, we are a biocomputer."

“But it is also sculpture, seen from all directions as comprehended by our imagination.”

“Poetry balances itself. It is a quality of art.”

“Similar to sculpture.”

Paisley lights up, a swirling candy cane of color passing across his face, cheeklamps cycling smoothly through the rainbow.

Lyra lights up, "I like the idea of hidden methodology! To just work. This is why the sculpting feels to bring my vision home. The success in art is not by waiting for inspiration, or somehow choosing the path, but through the act of doing."

They all stand quietly, the flat and quiet desert lurking around them. Above the sweeping ridge to their right, a planet has appeared alone in the gradient sky.

Seth doesn't really believe her. "Is it possible? I have recently noticed the ease at which I can feel the energy present in another person interacting with me. It is amazing what one sees when one pays attention to what is real."

Lyra reply-sings,

*How often do we realize the view around us?
Perceive not the screen of plate glass,
but an encompassing notion of movement through space.
Laws of physics prescribe things like speed,
set us firmly in our expectations, removing fear.
The dynamism propels arcs into time with every moment
of leg, finger, eyelash, lip, or heart.
The very expanse of these things coming together defines a dimension,
describes a place between movement and time.*

•••

Mirage-like lines are rolling in from the salts, compressing the image of the other side into impossibly thin stratifications. There, rusty mountains lean to the north. It is hard to see, late sun reflecting white into their eyes as they make their way along the Realm of Hades. Nothing lives here. How can there be an oasis.

Is it freefall? Salt-blind, they all stagger forward, slowly one foot at a time, each moment a glimmer of the next. Several minutes of spinning, a ride wave urging on and on and on. Words appear, gravel-voiced harmonic singing, in their heads all the vowels exaggerated:

*Living through art, being creation, tapping*
*quantum torus even now too tensed.*

*Drink in and sponge, resolve as exuberant*
*sound, searching pathways to action.*

*Regardless of approach these three,*
*attentions swimming as awareness,*
*flood senseless into consciousness*
*and outward in expression.*

*Energy of the creator reified*
*finds its way to deep connections,*
*intuition carries them along*
*pathways occupied by dreams,*
*a tumbling gyrus endlessly expansive.*

•••

Leg by leg around bush by cactus branch, stopping to drink, snorting things to help jolt their brains out of the increasing hallucinations. When they first started, it did not seem so bad. After seeing the pet rock fool them is when things get complicated. As they meander another hour, slightly north and slightly east to miss the salt flats, the dreams start to taper off.

*Stopped by a curtain of green light, slight figures emerge like mist of barely distinguishable forms, creeping toward them as if invading the very space of the mind.*

ROAD ROAD ROAD

The words flash at Seth, green and ephemeral, awaking him from a vision. Paisley stands ahead of them. How did that happen? Or did they turn around?

Beyond them is a dirt road that was not there before, stuck between the crystal white salt flat and the beige foothills scruffy with vegetation, a wide and well-packed dirt road disappearing into rust colored haze. The sun is setting opposite the newly risen planet, they can't see far against the illusions swept by orange and gray slopes behind. So they collect themselves and start walking the road side-by-side.

"I'm feeling like we're by a lake." Lyra wonders aloud to announce her own return to consciousness.

Seth explains, "It's coming back. We're a purple ponytail."

Paisley's ROAD ROAD ROAD scrolls to his left, replaced from the right: TORUS

They walk and begin to smell the humidity. Before long, they approach a large pool of water nearly hidden by grasses and bushes. The rising moon and silvering landscape has the pond glistening at the edges, reflective glooping mercury or some other heavy metal crawling up the sides. It looks like an oil spill.

"I don't know what that is, but do not drink it."

Goferaizai hears them from the opposite end of the pond, where he hides in the tall sawgrass surrounding most of the bank. The travelers, hungry to feel they have found the right place, decide to continue to the center at night. The road here is wide, and their receding shapes soon combine into the dark jungle.

Satisfied, the large tortoise slowly crawls towards the setting sun, into the low vegetation between desert and oasis, munching on a cactus branch.
