"Wow"

The inside space is large. Bigger than the sports stadiums in the cities, it reaches into the tip of the mountainside, an oblong cushion of trapped air, maybe a kilometer or two long judging by Paisley's display of supersonic echo location timings, mapping where ever they spelunked.

At different levels the floor reaches into the ceiling in speleothem columns, but the shapes do not match. The frozen cupcake and dripstone cone look of most calcite caves isn't apparent here. Seth runs his fingers across the smoothed grooves of a nearby column nearly around as he is, "The columns look machined, but–"

Lyra interrupts, "but those shapes at the tops would say they were carved out of the dripping rock, yeah?" Her head was pointed up, but Seth can't see like her ultraviolet eyes. To him the column head is buried in darkness.

Seth nods. "Stalactitic calcite. Drippy rock is right. These must have started as really large columns." He moves closer and looks up while his hand feels the grooves spiraling downward. As he turns around the shape, his fingers remain on the grooves and trace them down until he is resting his palm on the unblemished rock near the floor of the cave. The entire base of the column had smooth surfaces up until the grooves start their spiral upward.

Seth stands and takes two steps back to look at Lyra. "This is a stalagnate pillar that's been carved. See how the grooves run out to the foot that looks like a bunch of sunny-side-up eggs piled top of each other?"

A long display lit up under Paisley's chin, one word began chasing itself from one side of his fake grin to another. Then the word began to move in steps across the display, one letter at a time. Then as each collected on the other side, they switched to form a single diagonal line that moved like it was propelled by a spinning rod, the word scrolling by in a dull red:

BARBER

Seth and Lyra look at each other quizzically. "I don't know what BARBER means," Lyra says, "but it must have something to do with the spirals. Those grooves, do they spin around the whole thing like this?"

Paisley is having fun with the chasing ribbon of BARBER spinning across his jaw, he starts changing the colors into swirls of rusty lines to try and match the colorful limestone, which appears to have streaks of pink and gray against the cloudy brown ochre of the surrounding agate. With their cave lamps shining behind, the columns give off a warm blood-colored glow that seems to emanate from the inside.

"Oh stop doing that, they almost look... _alive_."

Seth drops his light and nods to the column, "Dolomite is interesting at the mineral scale, there's less magnesium, so the calcium forms in layers, and it's much harder than normal limestone, it even has traces of iron. You could say it's the more organized mineral, in fact..."

"Ok professor, don't lose me."

"Sorry, habit," Seth shrugs in the gloom, a little bit flattered to get a pet name, but a little more anxious because of it. They cannot see very far from their bubble of headlamps and stationary diode plants, so hopefully Lyra doesn't notice the fear welling up, "but luh, look at the grooves, they follow the lines of color!"

Lyra bends closer, the texture of this thing feels like a stack of highly polished gemstones arranged in continuous lines, only they are diagonal. Her thin fingers trace them, surprised to discover they change with depth, but not width. Tiny collections, wide groups, unchanging parallel lines, troughs that looked as if they were purposeful or eroded in exactly the right way. The manicuring seems perfect.

She squats down to the same spot Seth had reached, and looks back across her shoulder at him, playing with a small flashlight. The BARBER rotating through Paisley's weird spindle-shaped grin pulses like a warmly glowing beacon. She cannot make out what that's supposed to mean, without a voice Paisley tended to be extremely terse.

Seth sighs, "I can't get this laser to work. I need a sample of this that won't harm the grooves, Paisley can you...?"

The cave goes nearly black when the beaming BARBER animation blinks out. Seth had not realized how much of the cave illumination was from the tiny screen. Paisley reaches into a side pocket to reveal a small device that looks like some sort of thick metal pill, small enough to fit in an adult hand, but heavy. Grabbing by both sides, it unfolds and elongates, extending out with a whir. A searing whine is followed by Paisley pulling back and flipping a thumb-sized oblong sample of quartz-looking material towards Seth, all in one motion that was over before it felt possible.

Seth grabs the newly carved rock out of the air. He turns the striated, pinkish-white cross-section briefly against the light of his lamp, and then stashes it among the pockets on his vest.

Starting with a salute in the direction of Paisley, he gestures to the back of the cavern with his gloved hand.

"Well, let's go across."

•••

In the orange light of their headlamps the piece of rock glitters gold. Seth turns it back and forth in his hand, pulls out a small cylinder about the size of a finger and points it to the rock. The device bursts a strange rainbow of colored lasers from the end closest to the shard, deep purples and violet-blue flashes suddenly illuminating the smaller cavern around them.

The tool's smooth surface comes alive with a rolling catalog of the thing in Seth's hand. He clicks the instrument closed and pockets it.

"Does basalt in a carboniferous cave seem odd to you?"

Lyra looked at him, shrugged "how would I know?" with a smirk.

"Ok sorry, but those columns we passed earlier, those are all calcite– I mean, carbon." Lyra's eyebrows raise a lot when he starts using technical words she doesn't know. He needs to remember to avoid it.

"It's just odd to me that we'd find a tiny shard of igneous rock in a limestone cave."

Lyra snorts, "*Nothing* surprises me about how odd any of this is. We crossed that fucked up desert to get here and barely found this oasis before we all met our makers."

"Do you think we have different makers, Lyra?"

"Of course we do, Seth. You're human, I am not."

Seth isn't sure about that anymore.

Paisley's sweeping electronic arpeggio grunt interrupts their verging conversation and both turn to look where he has wandered a bit down the passage. Two beams of light flick on from each side of his jaw onto a pile of loose rocks at his feet. They all glitter like the one in Seth's hand.

They run up to see what nearly tripped Paisley, who widens the spotlights to reveal a rough, arched doorway carved into the rock. Falling through and blocking the way is a slope of basalt shards.

There are hundreds? Thousands? More? Seth breathlessly almost-questions, "the next room must be full of them–"

"Or they were piled at the doorway on purpose. Let's see if we can move any of it."

Lyra plants a new diode cluster, sets it to amber, and all three of them start scraping rocks away from the door by its glow. Seth tries to fill the eerie cave silence. "My grandmother used to have a bowl of these big glass grapes and marbles in her sitting room. Moving these around sounds exactly like it did when I moved those things around in the bowl."

Avalanches of shards begin sliding as those stuck blocking the bottom slope are moved away. Paisley is shoveling large piles of them buried up to his thighs. Seth wonders if the space they're in will hold all these shards.

Lyra notices it too. "I hope this isn't the bottom of some weird sideways dream hourglass that only fits as much as there is on the other side, I mean what if–"

"Lyra, look" Seth and Paisley have stopped and have some of the shards in their hands, Seth is holding the first one in his left, not sure of what he's seeing.

"They're the same? I mean the white streaking is different and the glittering, but *look at the shape*. They all have a perfect angle on one side."

He puts three of them between the fingers of his other hand and shoves them up into Paisley's spotlight. It was plain to see. What could have easily been misinterpreted as a fluke of natural design appeared identical on each shard: the ends were carved into matching 60° angles.

A shiver runs up the back of Seth's neck. Lyra visibly shudders. Paisley looks back at the rock pile and drops them into more modest darkness as he wades back into the pile. The space at the top of the archway is widening with each pile they pull back.

The shards themselves aren't very sharp, but extremely hard. Seth remembers from his required year in geology lab that basalt is *aphantic*, the particles are tiny and the lava they come from cools extremely quickly. Was there something about crystals in lava? He didn't think that could happen with obsidian, but maybe basalt could form like this and fracture off in patterns? If he could get some silica tests done on these he might...

\<KRRRBPLSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH>

All three of them jump backward as the top of the pile shudders and starts rushing downward, but none of them move because all the basalt is flowing down the opposite side of the doorway, away from them. The sound goes on for what seems like forever but probably only lasted 45 seconds, filled by an enormous rattling echo and reverberation beyond the other side.

"I think we found the big room."

•••

The extent of the main cavern runs downward, at least as far as they can see from here. The roof of the two big spaces they've been through sat 20-40m above them depending on the rock formations. This doesn't change on the other side of the door, but the cavern immediately drops off and downward on a long slope without an end.

"I think the pile of shards ends ahead of us down this slope," guessing they were put against the door to block is ringing more true. "If you ask me, the thicker part of it was on our end, so the back side gave way easily."

"That seems like someone plugged it from the surface end."

"Yup. But more like a hastily covered crime scene than a really good plug, dontchyou think?"

A few shards fall and move around as they position themselves around the inside of the doorway. About half of it was revealed now, and it is easy to push the remainder of the rock through because it immediately begins to tumble down the steep slope in front of them.

The echoes of small, hard objects tumbling against each other creates a wall of noise with each foot step they take to get through the pile of igneous rubble.

"Look, to the side, this one, it's flat." Lyra leaps effortlessly across the rocks to a dirty knoll that looks like it melts into a path of some kind around the edge of the cave. Seth follows and nearly loses his balance before Paisley brings up the rear and scoops him onto the dirt, lying directly in front of her. Lyra can't keep a quick giggle down and immediately clears her throat, "aah aha well, you made it!"

Seth feels dizzy being handled like an infant and placed onto the ground by Paisley, but shakes his head and gets to his feet while brushing dirt and dust from his knees and thighs. The space they can see with the brightest of Paisley's spotlights is shaped like a large, terraced bowl. The pathway they are on now drifts downward, counterclockwise to lower terrace levels. These appear to get smaller and end in a large space with a forest of some kind in the center. As if reading Seth's mind, Paisley's smile flashes in bright green: NOTREE

They begin walking the path to their right and spiraling down. The large space so meticulously sculpted does not feel dangerous, though none of them really know how far inside the oasis they've traveled. They haven't met any others. The crunching of their footsteps echos cleanly through and back to them as they descend lower and lower.

Several hours go by. Maybe a day. Seth isn't sure. They have been walking for a long time. The gradual slope has made the steps easy enough, but without Paisley lighting it up, they seem to be on a slow road into deeper darkness with every step. The injury in his left thigh has made half of it go numb, and it throbs slightly with each downward movement.

Then without warning the trail ends on flat ground, and they're at the bottom. Seth nearly runs into Paisley, who has stopped just short of a chasm that looks like it runs both downward and sideways at the same time. The narrow moat surrounds what looks like a manicured forest of trees far off and downhill from them.

"How the hell do we get across this? It looks like it goes down for eternity."

The effect was real, shining a light into the gap made the edges appear to extend downward forever. When the light moved, however, so did the lines.

"No..." Seth steps between his two companions and kneels at the edge. Their directional lights make the edges look confused. He slowly pushes his hand along the side of the dirt path and his fingers feel their way onto a solid surface. Alarmed and staying careful, he traces the surface with a fingertip for a few centimeters until he feels the sharp, downward angle of the edge.

"How many diodes do we have left?"

"Two. So we should use them–"

But before Lyra can finish, Seth grabs the handle of a plant, cracks the seal on one end, and throws it over the edge. There is no bottom from where they can see. The splayed and springy legs of the plant, now completely illuminated, bounce around and down the narrow pit. Lit from below by the falling diode plant, they can make out a swirling pattern of smokey-translucent tiles to their right. A path onto the middle circle. The spiral of the obsidian tiles matched exactly the angle of the downward path, so they carefully continued along the same direction and felt their way across the impossibly floating stepping stones and into the middle.

"That's actually very natural once you know about it," Seth proclaims, "moving down the outside and into the center as a continuous spiral just makes sense. But now that we're in the center, are we on some sort of plateau?"

The ground rock rises slightly as they approach the underground forest. Foreboding black bodies huddled in perfect patterns around each other, rows of tree shapes extend from the ground, their roots intertwining in large arches and angles. The smallest of them is bigger than their ride here, all three could sit inside the trunk of one of these trees.

"The roots become the rock here. They're fused. Can we use the other diode plant to see better?"

"No we cannot. May I remind you there's still the getting out of here to come, and I'm starting to feel a little spooked."

Alone, just the three of them, tiny humanoids at the center of what could be an ancient magma chamber for all they knew, the basalt shards certainly made it feel that way, but the more prevalent limestone made less sense. Mysterious geology at the center of a strange archaeology surrounded by the weather of a thousand simultaneous dreams.

"Mafic fulcrum."

Kyra turns from collecting a sample of the nearest tree. "Say what now professor?"

"Someone at Mawei. They said that, in a meeting, I... I can't really remember, my memories of there are so fuzzy now. It hurts sometimes, trying to remember."

"Then don't try. They treated you like shit there. Nevermind the global espionage." Kyra smirks in the darkness, showing her teeth. Seth glances at her, then past her at the long pile of basalt shards that have collected in rhombic piles on each terrace below the doorway. "Make sure to take one of those. We need to do chemical analyses of all three samples."

Seth looks dismayed. "You mean we have to traipse back through the Hetmaikaa?"

Lyra widens her grin into a laugh, "HA! No thanks, we'll make camp above. I have a labtent and kit. Paisley, can you do a full-scale imaging of this forest?"

"NOTREE" is still flashing in purples and blues at his mouth. The expression in his eyes is worrisome boredom. After a final flash, each letter of the word disappears one at a time. Then Paisley turns to the forest, raises his arms, and an enormous white flash fills the entire space.

Seth collapses.
