A room full of light.

Metallic walls of sterile ivory look inward to the colorless stalk of an artificial being. Following up its gelatinous lines to an ultralight, ultra detailed, mechanical blinking eye are the fibers for data and nutrition, silvery in the intense brightness.

It blinks. Slow and measured, un-mechanical, more fluid like analog.

Swift shift of place and space, vertical lines disintegrate the horizontal scan of the room and leave behind nothing as the sunny hillside shining replaces the white walls, and the horizon appears in solid block colors against blue.

Arid breeze and sand. He's been here before. Trapped here before. In elevations across the landscape, vague outlines of people stand out against the high contrast rock faces. Some seem to move without purpose or pain, while daring ones searched beyond the hill for more or tried their hand and foot at climbing the earth.

More central, a high viewpoint in rolling hills above myriad costumed dancers and musicians, sharing in their momentum the immediacy of this gathering. Tight ripples and oceans of sound fill the grotto side until the brim is spilling rhythms into a bamboo forest behind them, returning slightly less strong as if from edges far away the mountains knocked them back in reverberant approval.

Tightly arranged electronic sounds appear in concert with skin-head drums, an array of flutes and didgeridoo, choruses of drones from long-string instruments. A large trapezoid wooden-frame supports an enormous hammer dulcimer, fitted with sensors that feed into processors and become mixed along with bouncy articulations and extended manipulation.

To one side are three large metal tubs of water. Each terminates a cable tensioned between the bottom (bolted to the rock ground far below) and the upper reaches of the overhang where he watched. The gathered menagerie of an orchestra seems to reach a mystic chord in a frenzy of crescendo that vibrates the water in the tubs and sends a soulful sound over the edge of the precipice.

A phone rings. Phasing twitter surrounded by opposite engine roars.

Rattle and shuffle after a full creak into the warm interior. Syllables find their way and soon in a rush the cars come in again. Now interjections of voices drift and punch their way between the locking of a neighbor’s door and the steady feeding of a Nebelung cat.

Suggestions of plans mix with door slams and the faraway haze of a drowning freeway, lost underneath a windblown newspaper. The horn of a single passenger evolves into longer, steadier tones after brushes of leaves in the wind meet a hexagonal bamboo mobile. Then in creaks, a lone cricket alley-jumps, misses the squeaking brakes by a fraction of gravelly space.

As if in a swarm, the combustion engines whirling once punctuated now and again by a short, scream or cry, in the dampening crispy air. Far beyond a dog bark the sea mingles in tones with highway miracles, the rushing of bodies through thick walls of progressively tightening souls.

And in the fury of evening’s rush steams in ribbons of steely flesh the rattle of wheels as a train buries chiming roadblocks swinging in barbershop themes and sending the skyward eyes flipping through time. Tracing shadows as the mind hits the pen, screaming arrives in calmer ways and subsides as stars brush the clouds firmly aside.i

In chords, a train whistle.

The door slams. He is pushed, twisted around.

Nothing in any research facility is ever top secret. High standards of air pollution regulation and environmental control create a need for more cooperation and learning between manufacturers of artificial goods. Procedures, formulae, and other intellectual property are usually published in widely distributed scientific journals, chat channels, and announcement boards.

A voice appears.

*Frames of reality are manipulated when the chaos generator is used, but in an experimental build human brain cells are inserted to encourage the ability to form intelligence - a “brain” or “being” external to the sum of its parts. Immeasurable.*

An unseasonal coolness spreads across the afternoon. Tenacious winds sweep out the haze and crystalize the sky an impossible blue, edged by the overhanging fronds a giant bird-of-paradise, dancing in the clearing breeze. Green leaves split the air in wide gestures, longing blossoms drip sweet in thick amber insects. A soft song is on the air that seems to grow around him.

Seth manages to blink his eyes open wider, they're all outside now. It doesn't feel like a desolate center of a psychedelic desert, but maybe that is what they're supposed to feel like. Lyra's hips move closer to him, or are they Paisley's?

"Water please," he manages. Vision too blurry, a hand appears with a canteen and he swigs a cool drought. In just a few minutes he can see clearly, and yes it is Paisley next to him. Knowing he cannot answer, Seth asks anyway, like talking to a cat he lives with, "where'd she go?"

Paisley points to where they first came in. A round, olive tent has appeared to the far side of the low vegetation where the woman's voice is sailing carelessly. Seth cannot help but smile in the way she sings the words, like meandering haiku. In no time at all he has hiked most of the way, her voice growing stronger.

A great deal of the area where Hetmaikaa's frequencies cannot reach is inhabited by insects and several questionable ponds of stuff he isn't quite sure is water. "Not drinking it to find out," he told himself out loud as he walks the length to reach the squat disc of the labtent.

The structure is four rooms in an auto-expanding frame. It touches a memory Seth can't quite catch, one of those halloween pumpkin decorations made from tissue paper and cut so that it accordions together in a sphere. Seth walks the perimeter until he finds Lyra sitting inside one of the quadrants. She has out a small leather case and their rock samples from the limestone column, the flat triangle of basalt, and the chip from a "tree". She opens the small latch on the front to show him a stick or a piece of bone.

Seth works to cross his legs in the space barely large enough for a single researcher.

"Nice office."

"Feeling better? You took quite a spill in there, it's a good thing you weren't near the edge."

"Thanks for whatever happened, I mean... what happened, exactly?"

"Paisley snapped a pic, that's about it. When we turned to head back, you were in a lump on the ground. What did you see?"

"Nothing. Well, I dreamt. Weird visions, people dancing, a bunch of chaotic words."

"That probably happened when we got you up here. On our trek back, you were shivering with some kind of reaction, I thought it might be a fever. Maybe the trees held some pathogen, was my thinking, so the quicker we could get you away from the forest the better."

"Thank you."

"De nada."

"What?"

"Nothing. It's nothing."

Seth takes a closer look at the object Lyra has pulled from the box. The shape might be something in the bone category, but the color certainly was not. Milky, cloudy, then almost transparent at the edges. It is splotched abstractly with color, like an animal's spots.

"Is that a bone?" Seth blurts. "That looks like a bone! Is there more of it? Where did you get this?"

"Easy easy, I don't know what it is. Paisley had this box when I found him. I thought it could be a primitive weapon maybe, or some sort of ornamental piece? I mean yes it does have a 'bone' feel to it, but it is so light and so weird."

Weird is right. Seth takes it from Lyra and runs his finger across the jagged edge. There's a fracture on the tapered end, splitting a section where he can feel a regular pattern of barbs – or what's left of them. Shining a light behind the object he can see tiny, irregular threads running through it. Old pathways dirtied by time, severed at the end where it is split. He sets it back in its box.

"It reminds me of crab legs. And that I'm hungry for something other than fruity meat squares."

They both get up in a difficult dance of close coordination and rotate out of the small quarter-tent space. Paisley is down the perimeter of the underbrush near a large outcropping of bamboo. Light fades, and the tops of the plants look like silhouettes of ponytails. As they approach, Seth comments "That bamboo grows thinly. That tip with the fluffy long leaves reminds me of something."

Paisley has dug a small pit for a campfire next to a groundwater pond tucked near the bamboo. Noticing them walking his way, he throws an armful of dry kindling into the hole and a cone of flames flashes from one side of a glove. To Seth and Lyra the campfire appears to light instantaneously, dancing magically upside down in the smooth water of the pond in front of them.

"Great going bud!" Lyra sings out, "it will be a cold time around here in about six hours. Woooow! That water is... I can see all the way to the bottom!" This reservoir isn't opaque like the one on the way to the labtent. Lyra grabs a handful of foil bags from Paisley's pack and tosses them near the edge of the clearing where Seth is squatting. He skips pebbles down the length of the water, ripples mixing campfire flames with the reflected purple dusk. Barely notices the food thrown at him. The pool or channel that reaches out to the bamboo here reminds him a lot of the obsidian-covered chasm.

"Just a minute ago you were about to drop for starvation," Lyra noted through her teeth as she rips open a mealpac, and before she spits the wrapper into the fire, "what is wrong with you now?"

"This pond. It's not like the others. I know it looks completely different, but you know, none of my ripples are coming back. It's like there's no other side. And the patterns of the rocks moving down, they look like that pit of a moat. Except filled with water." Seth holds up his elemental scanner, screen side to Lyra, so she can see the glowing "H2O" scrolling around its smooth circumference. "This blind of bamboo hanging across the far end isn't where this body of water ends."

"At least it's drinkable?" Lyra turns her head across to Paisley, who nods in affirmation. Apparently he's tried it already, and his internals are either good at cleansing it or its just water.

"We'll boil it. I don't know what biomorph stomach he has but I'm not taking any chances." Seth grunts as he gets up, mutters something about doing more squats, and pulls his pack onto the sandy ground. Rattling around inside he finds stacked cookware and starts to assemble a tripod over one side of the fire.

"After we eat and get some rest, we'll head down again," Seth proclaims. Lyra nods. Paisley stares at the horizon. In the darkening the flames are casting large, oblong shadows onto the blind of bamboo behind them, making it look like they are dancing between the trunk poles to a snapping, crackling, subtle roaring sonata of the fire.

"And this time we're taking that crab bone with us."
