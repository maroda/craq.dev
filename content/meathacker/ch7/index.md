Sunrise on the Hetmaikaa is sudden. From their standpoint in the middle filterzone, there is very little time between noticing "the sun might be up soon!" to it lasering across the flat plain. The depressed oasis is the only respite for miles, where pilgrimages find the eye of the somnambulist hurricane.

The overhanging vegetation adapted in layers across the small dimple of desert, allowing a micro-ecosystem to thrive and a micro-climate to develop, as travelers carried in and deposited seeds and other traveling burrs. Bamboo rose in some places like their hideaway, barrel cacti dotted any sun-drenched spot. Further in and down, humidity rises and tropical plants give way to a depression in the center, where they can enter the complex.

The circle of jungle does not cool off as much as it transfers energy. So while the heat is bearable next to their clean water grotto of reeds and grass, the humidity is soaking into everything, including their moods. The best remedy for this is to get out of it, so they lock their packs together around a thick tuft of bamboo trees. It gives Seth another uncomfortable flashback of a logo he still cannot work out in his head.

With a traveling bag across each shoulder, they stand and look towards the sunrise on the other side of the bamboo. The silence above ground is eerie here, held in standing waves or some other configuration that keeps the dreams out. Now that they're rested and ready to explore, familiar with the caves in case they meet danger, and more readily equipped to deal with it.

All three turn at once, almost like a dance, onto a well-worn path they find extending to the end of the pool, disappearing into a separation of bamboo. This joins the main road further up from the labtent, which is still standing and appears to be untouched out by the poisoned pool.

The jungle cover here is denser than Seth remembers from last night, but they got here in the dark. Making it through the desert didn't top wanting to see the entrance when they survived the trek. Exhausted still, they rushed to the center to make sure they had found the right place. They were unlikely to fail since there is only one dead spot in Hetmaikaa, but it felt victorious all the same.

The water temple in full daylight does not resemble the creepy, vine-covered monstrosity that his mind had concocted half-awake the evening before. It is nicely separated from the jungle by a half-dais, where large frames of stone are filled with large white granite gravel. Behind the semicircle stands the temple, and behind the temple looms the water source itself.

"The ground is breathing," Seth exclaims in a half-voice, pointing at the source.

Up behind the main temple, no bigger than a small cabin, huge mounds of rock with moss and lichen are grouped in semi-regular shapes that guide the liquid pillowing around them. The terrain looks to be under a thick cell wall, like when ice forms on slow mountain creeks. There is a slight current, and the way water moves down the face of the steep hillside catches the sunlight above. Without any break in the smooth outpouring of water, the result makes it appear the land itself is breathing.

"Where is that coming from? I don't remember seeing water underground," Lyra asks, craning her neck to see the top of the hillock in the sun.

"I also don't remember hearing any water coming in, but I don't hear it now either."

"Yeah no I didn't hear it."

Seth starts towards the arch in the temple that leads inside, explaining as he walks, "the formations in the first cave, those are created by water. The caverns we were in could be a lot older than this temple, carved out by the same water thousands of years ago, is my guess. Probably before all this was here," waving to the area around them.

In the daylight, it is easier to see that the sections of the dais have troughs between them, carrying water from the source into different areas of the jungle. It is reasonable to think the designers meant to divert water, that used to flow through the limestone, into the lush oasis.

"I can't believe this is so quiet, this whole waterworks. I feel like it should be splashing with activity!" Lyra turns to follow Seth into the temple. Paisley bends down to put his finger into the water of a nearby trough, filling a small vial on the back of his hand by some sort of suction.

One by one they bow through the short temple doorway and into a manufactured crawlspace tying the water temple to the underground cavern system. They had discovered the way in when Paisley traipsed across one of the huge shale floor tiles in the dark and Lyra noticed the resonance changing. Upon further knocking around the floor, they couldn't find an obvious way to move the thick tile, so Paisley climbed to the high vaulted ceiling and jumped on it. This broke up the tile quite enough and they found roughly placed rock steps leading down a short tunnel.

At the end stands a vertical crack in the rock face. "Tunnel was dug orthogonally to the first chamber," Seth notes out loud. "Like they were boarding a spaceship, it's not a real entrance. There must be some other access around the oasis at some other level–"

"SHH!" Lyra spits, nearly crushing Seth's throat throwing her open hand behind her, staring through the fissure intently, just a meter or so ahead.

Seth stops short, with Paisley crouching behind him, getting a better view through the crack. It is too dark, but there are sounds. Repeating sounds. Something making sounds. Seth goes wide-eyed, wide-eared if that's possible, trying to discern what he's hearing.

Lyra cannot make it out either, "It sounds... prickly" she whispers. "Bats?"

"There's no cave opening we found. Bats need a way out. This must be something subterranean. Lights off."

All three of them reach for their headlamps and turn themselves into darkness. The sound seems louder in complete darkness. It is not quite a scampering, there are dots of percussive pings on the limestone beyond, and in the smaller space they have a quick echo, like being in a large warehouse with gemstones as walls and floors.

The noises fade into an almost inaudible wash of movement. Lyra's eyes narrow, "Does that sound li–"

\<WHABANKMPKRACTHCKTCH!>

The trio nearly falls to their feet in a cloud of dust they can taste, a shard of rock hits the side of Seth's cheek and draws blood. He raises his hand instinctually to his face and gasps. Paisley has snapped his jawlamps on full and is stepping forward to the crack, which now looks less like a human-sized hole and more like an oblong diamond-shaped doorway.

Paisley's light filters through the dust as a beam into the cavern beyond, which has the effect of immediately riling up whatever was making the sounds and they all seem to scatter until there's nothing. A lose edge of the broken rock drops clumsily to Lyra's feet and breaks the silence.

Lyra beats Seth to the punch, "I think we know why the doorway was blocked."

Seth laughs in spite of his torn cheek, adjusts his headlamp, and stares along the path of their moving lights through the entrance. There's nothing.

"Whatever those were, they've moved out of the first cave. I'm stepping in."

Slowly, Seth crawls sideways to fit down the narrowing path and edges his left arm and leg into the opening. He stops, waits for something to chew off his fingers, and when it doesn't happen pulls his shoulders and head through and into the space.

Seth's voice comes back with a deep reverb behind it, "Empty... I don't see anything." He pulls the rest of his body through. Soon Lyra and Paisley are in, and they automatically stand in a triangle with their backs to each other, lamps pointed outward, scanning the entire space.

"The ancillary tunnel we found is the only way from this space to the forest bowl."

\<SShshshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhtht.>

A noise creeps out of the echos they recognize from the larger cavern. Lyra starts in the direction of the noise, "Speaking of. That sounded like something on that ramp of rock shards."

Seth nods, "I missed the note somewhere that warned 'ancient evil here, do not unblock this doorway' but a pile of movable rock just didn't seem unsurmountable by a demon."

Lyra is on her way to the access room on the far end, where they had cleared a path into the massive area. There are noticeably fewer shards in the doorway now. Seth doesn't know if they moved that many on their way out or if something else did.

Lyra stops short again.

\<SShshtht. SShshtht. SShshshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhtht.>

After each shift of the rocks, echos blared back, creating a cacophony of avalanching noise. Another prickling of sounds that gives them the impression that a bunch of somethings are running.

"Through the door. We need to figure out what that is. Careful of the rock slide happening here."

Lyra is through first, and pulls Seth in behind her. The cleared shards had been moved to the inside, like they were dug out from the terrace beyond. As Paisley steps up behind the others and swings his jaw to the left, they all see what has been a mystery.

And it sees them.

•••

The next few moments are jagged and blurred. Lyra yells "WHAT" when Seth can only think "DOWN THE SLOPE" but before he can yell it Paisley jumps and pushes all three of them over the edge and down a rolling slide of basalt shards that quickly become an avalanche, depositing them down a half-kilometer, slamming into the narrow flat between the terrace path and chasm moat. Shovelfuls of basalt emptied past them into the space, tumbling down with increasingly distant echoes.

Lyra jumps to her feet and peers up. Paisley's spotlights are scanning above, showing that their cracked wall entrance was snug against the top of the cavern, but the terrace continues clockwise upward and through an oval arched entryway.

"My guess is our interloper disappeared into that there hole," Lyra suggested in a way that meant there really was no other place it could have gone. Her close-fit sleeves were torn to pieces and droplets of bright red blood dribbled down her dark arms from dozens of tiny igneous scratches. Tucking into a ball and rolling herself in a controlled way meant a lot less bruising but a lot more contact.

Seth wasn't so lucky, his bad left leg drifted out and caught several times on the edges of the terraces as the momentum of a million small rocks showered down. Not broken, but he stayed sitting for the moment.

The being did not chase them, in fact in Seth's memory he isn't sure it came at them at all. One second they were through the human-sized doorframe and the next they were all staring up into big, reflective eyes surrounded by jointed appendages. Mandibles maybe, and other longer limbs, antennae endings swinging at them from above. The confused flashes of light in the blackness makes his recollection seem like a horror show.

"Do you think it's coming back?"

Lyra looks thoughtful, "I am not sure, that thing certainly wasn't hunting us. It seemed as bugged out as we were."

Seth chuckles weakly at the pun. Lyra continues with a smirk, "and I think it had designs to get out. We already know that entrance hole was put there by something trying to get in. But once we cleared enough of those rocks from the doorway, our friend was able to get through and charge the crack. We just happened to be approaching."

"Or we clued it into where the crack is."

Paisley nods at this, as he points to the top, his spots barely able to catch a large gray shadow disappearing through the doorway. Seth manages to rise on his bad leg, and limps to rest his left arm on Paisley's shoulder, watching it scamper away.

Lyra wastes no time, "It still has to get through that crack and several meters of tunnel way too small for how large it looks. But I have a feeling it won't stop trying. Let's get to the forest."

Seth backs up and crosses behind Paisley, whose spots are dimmed low, the round jowls of his jaw glowing amber, like another pair of eyes on the bottom of his cheeks. They follow one by one, Lyra taking up the rear walking backwards with her vision locked on the doorway.

Before they step across the obsidian tiles, Seth points his toe on one to make sure they're still there. Then his tool bag is open and as he crosses the chasm he sticks blazetags – tiny LEDs arranged in a throbbing pattern on a nanoparticle adhesive that can stick to practically anything, including glass – under each obsidian tile he crosses. The blueish glowing of the tags makes it seem like a purplish light comes from the chasm itself. The reflections on rocks below look oily metallic, not very different from the rotten pool outside.

Paisley looks back at Lyra before crossing, who has turned from door watching and starts to edge her way across the tiles. His jaw swirls into deeper green-gray colors as he follows her, the word forming on his imaginary teeth as they reach the other side.

He cocks his head and squints, not sure what his own display is saying. The letters read: CHITIN
