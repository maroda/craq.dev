Official Report to Office of the Bursar Stadt
Alliance of Western Territories

Subject: Mawei Biomorph Capability Investigation

The nanotech used to develop the first artificial species was tested in cactus mimics. Bioengineered at molecular levels, these plants went through early chaos induced growth spurts meant to bond the synthetics into its own cells. When subjected to the correct chaos field, this creates quantum symbiosis, allowing new aspects of the protein structures to replicate as they did. The spines were found to be unbreakable and self-healing.

Today, these beings are complex beasts of wild imagination that have mobility in a multitude of arrangements. Strange wheels clinging to the end of longish stalky legs, or rolling barrels slung between hulking masses in tandem, five wide. Legs, sure, but other slithering and crawling mechanisms can be found. Plenty of tentacles.

Although non reproductive, each is a living Biomorph construction perfected with synthetic AI/CH: Power InTell. A maintenance contract is all that's needed to keep them running. This typically means all models are tracked for software updates and Biomorph repair or replacement.

The organ systems are advertised as a unique combination of regular cells with high-tension, electro-impulse Biomorphic molecules. All the marketing material will tell you that the cell tissue is introduced to highly controlled chaos generators. Natural and systemic evolution in the culture is achieved, but these cannot be grown into life. These are combined and infused into manufactured cell tissue. From these come larger building blocks more familiar in machine construction. Modular design with high tolerances at interaction points is encouraged. From these, entirely new organ systems are invented and built. Devices and machines are constructed from this biomechanical menagerie.

Incubation is an important process: if the quantum balance of these molecular structures isn’t initiated properly, the paired biologic material will effectively “separate” from the catalyst, resulting in a messy catastrophic implosion. It is said testing was done in smoothed tile rooms that could be showered down and scraped clean of biomass.

In practice, the cellular synthetic is highly stable beyond its initial growth period, when the symbiosis is instilled. Experiments performed on organ systems developed early in the testing process proved a material that is tensile and malleable without losing strength or function. It is important to note that these are designed as closed systems. Specific parts are built to move and operate together in regular ways.

Biomorph incorporated into an already living being is in an experimental branch that is explicitly not licensed for public use. Research was halted as facilities in Old Burbank were shuttered along with the closing of Valley Bridge Dome due to rising tides through the upper counties.

Spec Recon reports no surviving cognizant entities, no further action is required.
