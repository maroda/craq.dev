Paisley turns his jawlamps towards the black forest that spreads through the center of the bowl. The land continues downward in a steady slope, not like the amusement park ride they just survived to get out of the way of something that probably was more scared of them than they were.

Distances and directions are deceiving on the bottom disc. The trees seemed closer when they looked from the distant ledges of the spiral terrace. Now at the bottom, there looks to be three or four kilometers to the first small trees. Paisley's calculations put them there in under an hour, with Seth's bad leg slowing them down a bit. He updates his mental model and accompanying spacial representation.

The artificial part of his face – from the jaw and beard downward – is the top of a larger apparatus that extends through his chest and torso, wrapping behind his body in silvery blue-grey ripples of stranded Biomorph. The lightweight, dense material runs diagonally in wider strips down through the hips, mimicking human muscle groups. What things are arranged beyond remains a mystery to most behind Paisley's tactical over-all jumper.

His jawpiece has no voice function, an unfortunate feature of the bodymod he chose, but his age and battle scars left his voice so inoperable that the extra cost was not as important to him as the best data intel packages available, leaving him the ability to hack and upgrade and reprogram. But no voice still makes communicating difficult, so he stays silent and lets his data collection sensors and analysis feedback run at all times. His brain finds deep sustenance on this activity, so he remains blissfully without opinion. Objectivity and living in the moment keep his homeostasis balanced. That and a healthy amount of cannabis.

THC itself isn't as important to the functioning of his biomorph, but the individual cannabinoids matter a great deal. These activate the prosthesis ability to bind with Paisley's own biology, merging dynamic homeostasis across the artificial and biological.

The shapeshifting nanoparticles of his beard have some sweet visuals, but functionally serve as a shape-shifting tongue. It is the most nimble and malleable part of Paisley's Biomorph. He dances with it, can hypnotize with it, measure and create electro-magnetic waves, even absorb harmful radiation. Integrated with his jawlamps and mouth/teeth-display, it is Paisley's richest form of expression and most lethal weapon combined.

Right now, his enhanced human eyes gaze towards the forest, Lyra and Seth ahead in their headlamps, his own jawlamps bouncing in wide circles ahead of them on the beachy surface of the inner forest disc. As they get closer to the first edge of trees, the gravel starts to get bigger, and after forty-five minutes of hiking they stop because the gravel has become too large for easy travel. It's now the same size as the large rocks in the temple dais, they have to be the same rocks. Paisley bends down, picks a fist-size piece of white granite, and tucks it into a waist satchel.

"Our personal roving science lab, always at work huh?" Lyra swings around to look at Paisley, the word CHITIN is still glowing in soft gray on his lips.

"What does that mean, Paisley?" He shrugs. His ears are good enough, some of the upper frequencies are muted, but he can still hear people talking to him through rebuilt inner ears.

Seth is fingering through the rough gravel. His headlamp swings in Lyra's direction.

"Huh." He stops a beat. "It's... insect skin, maybe?" A long second of silence passes and Seth suddenly turns, "Lyra! Where is the box with the bone?"

Lyra throws her knapsack on the uneven ground, bends over and produces the small leather package they were examining in the labtent. Seth takes it gingerly and unsnaps the lid. He carefully excises the bonelike shard of material and holds it up, to Paisley. He immediately brightens the CHITIN on his lips into a rich green, and flashes it for effect. The thing that pushed on the door was this stuff, and it's important that it's this stuff. Paisley can't yet piece together what word is telling him why.

"That animal up there, which I now am assuming is an animal, is at least partially made of this stuff. If we are to believe Paisley's system, and I tend to." Seth turns the curved piece in his hands, the light from his headlamp making it cloudy but translucent at the same time.

"So it's a bug that we just let out," Lyra announces a matter-of-factly. Seth nods comically, in a quick up-and-down motion that makes his headlamp jiggle. Lyra lets a chortle out. Paisley reaches to take the bone from Seth.

"Please... be careful..." as Paisley holds the piece in his large, stubby fingers. They extend from gloves made from the same material as the prosthetic torso, as if he was wearing knit mittens with the fingers cut off. The material is very robust, Paisley has no concerns. He notices the same pattern on the end that Seth ran his fingers across the night before.

Moving quickly in the dark he locates the pouch where he tucked a basalt shard. Paisley shuts off his teeth and jawlamps dim to warm amber, the dark around them feels like it is closing in. He takes the artifact in his beard and fits a net of tendrils around the broken end. Soft colors show the flow of energy into the bone from his attached Biomorph. He moves the rock in his hand close to his beard–

A sudden SNAP! rings in the cavern.

The impulse wave sounds like someone shot a pistol. Seth ducks like they're being fired on, covering his head, Lyra reaching out to balance against him, their headlamps akimbo.

The basalt shard is no longer in Paisley's hand. It sits a sparkling diamond fingernail atop the edge of the bone, rising on the end of his technicolor beard.

•••

Silence drops over them as the reverb fades. The weight of what they've learned sinks in. They were meant to find this. The bone, with Paisley, then Lyra, then Seth. Drawn to a name that doesn't appear on any map, just hints at land formations and guesses at directions. The three of them slowly turn together, looking in the direction of the door, several kilometers up.

Seth turns back and peers into the charcoal black of the forest. The quick movement of his headlamp makes him notice something. Quickly, Seth grabs his bag and starts clamoring over the rocks faster than his thigh and ankle can handle. He stops and turns to wave his partners on.

"We need to see these up close! Come on!" Seth's voice raises in pitch that echoes with an upward "OWIN!" in the underground bubble. He carefully rock-hops the final few meters to meet the first line of trunks.

From far away, the trees appear to be wide near the ground with tufts of curling leaves sprouting from the tops, like giant curls of thick underground palm trees. Now, as they get close enough to touch a small trunk that is still too wide for the three of them to circle, it's obvious now. The ridges of the bark or whatever is on the outside, all move in parallel lines in a rising spiral.

"The angle looks the same to me," Lyra comments while Seth runs his finger down the skin of the tree, referring to their limestone column discovery the day before.

"I am not sure this is a tree," Seth mumbles to himself, just loud enough that it brings Lyra up next to him.

"What did you say?" She reaches up into the leaves, low enough for her to touch here, and the whole shape springs back and forth as she plucks it. A small edge falls off in her hand, that she nearly instinctively hands over to Paisley, whose face already reads in bright blue: CARBON

"Handy signage on that thing bud," Seth says through a grin. For effect, Paisley flashes the word off and on and off and on and off again, with increasing brightness until nearly the entire cavern seems illuminated with hot blue light.

Seth clamors, "Stop–"

"What is it! Paisley off!" Lyra yells, runs to Seth, who is clutching his head and reeling a little. He is already on one knee at the side of the trunk, using the tree to keep himself from falling over. Lyra shucks her headlamp to the gravel where it blinks off and reaches over to Seth's and flicks the power on his. In the sudden blackness, Seth regains himself quickly, whispering because the lights were now all out, and that felt the most natural:

"I... felt, like... faint, I was falling, except I wasn't."

By the end of his sentence, Seth's consciousness had returned. He takes off the headlamp and shakes his head, holding it down between his knees.

"Ok, Paise, no more big lights?" Lyra shoots at Paisley. He feels puzzled how it is becoming clear this relationship between lights and Seth. His data does not show a direct cause. Complexity must be something he's prepared to abduct. The implanted bug, it could be a time-bomb.

Paisley turns a soft turquoise, pulls a small packet of something out of a pocket in the vicinity of a vest, sits and begins rolling the material into a small rectangle of paper he slips from one end of the pocket. When he's satisfied with the roll, he holds the fresh joint up in his right hand and a "BLESSHHT" of steam cradles it for a second or two.

"Is that what I think it is?" Seth wonders out loud as he watches Paisley calmly finish the roll. A blue flame appears on the side of his glove and he puts one end of the rolled paper into the lighter until it glows red. With a slicing sound that rings clear into the cave, a hollow clip appears off the side of his jaw, tucked beside a lamp circle, glowing blueish. Paisley raises the joint to Seth and then places it snugly in the clip. He inhales strongly, closing his eyes, taking down half of the thing in one breath is what it seemed like. He is kind enough to exhale away from Lyra and Seth.

Lyra smirks at him, "oh yes it is. Runs on it or something."

"Does he ever share?"

"You don't want that. It's not gonna give you the high you think. Kinda yes but loads of other cannasomethings that make all that biomorph be bio and not rejected. I mean it's your own trip so be my guest, but not really worth it when you can get better stuff. His weed is absolutely GMO."

This makes Paisley feel slightly fuzzy. He looks in the direction of Lyra, rolls his head around, and in a memory of a laugh he shows on his false grin: S.W.E.D.

•••

"Did Paisley come up with "RUET 2OUEN SLAY"? They are on their way back up, the normal clockwise-way up the terrace road. The levels gain elevation as if a giant spiral cone had been placed into the sand, one continuous rising line that measures a half-dozen meters across, sometimes widening but mostly consistent around the circumference of the bowl. Not particularly flat, they have noticed.

Stumbling on a giant groove cut into one edge of the path, Lyra yells "watch it!" and thrusts her arm out to catch Seth before he tumbles backward onto Paisley, dropping instead into the ditch. "The last thing we need is to find ourselves at the bottom again, it's getting late."

Tumbling down the half kilometer slope of basalt actually helped them shave a few hours off their visit, long enough to get the closer look at the pseudo-trees. But the longer trek was going back uphill, because the bowl itself was around 6 kilometers in diameter, which meant four rotations of 18km, uphill.

"Almost exactly the size of the oasis," Seth wonders aloud.

"Is it?" Lyra asks back.

"I think it is, yeah. Judging by the distances we've traveled, the jutting out of the pools to the edges beyond the thicker undergrowth, the oasis must sit perfectly atop a subterranean heated bubble of air." Seth rises from one knee, accomplishes nothing by motioning to rub off his already filthy pants, and starts forward again. Lyra and Paisley fall in step.

Seth, glances back at Paisley. "Well? Was that you?"

Paisley feels a little out of breath, not because his body can't handle the trek, but because he is running low on fuel. He stops, looks up at Seth. The mystery of where he was before the extensive surgery is wrapped into those letters. He lets them chase across his face, each letter slowly looping through the rainbow at different speeds: RUET 2OUEN SLAY

"Leave it on Paise, it's better light than these headlamps. I have gummies at camp."

Paisley has gummies with him but he would rather help his companions anyway so the three word, thirteen character, cryptic rainbow continues to give off a warm but eerie glow around the trio as they climb. More of the large ditches are avoided.

Seth believes the cavernous bowl itself may be some sort of sandstone or other sedimentary rock that makes up the majority of the underground here. On a geology scale, the smaller stadium of limestone looks like it's much newer.

There are still details that do not fit. The ante-tunnel and doorway into the bowl cavern lie tucked into one end of the stadium. This cave is also fairly narrow, the limestone columns are a few dozen meters in height before hitting the uneven folds of the roof. Before water was diverted by the temple above, there must have been some down here. A creek or riverbed that this water followed, and if they could find that, they could find where the water went out. Which would keep them away from the crack being widened by their Chitin friend above.

"Hey I haven't heard much from our entryway up there, are we close enough to hear anything?"

Lyra flashes her headlamp in the direction of the doorway, it is close now. "Probably 20 meters?" She replies. "But on the next terrace up. I think we can climb it. Otherwise, we're spending another hour circling this, I think by the end of the day we'll have walked 80k already."

Seth agrees with a nod upward, and starts to look for handholds. Somewhere close to the ramp of basalt he finally sees a few that will work. After a boost by Paisley the two smaller humans scramble onto the final terrace.

Paisley looks up, exhausted, but then glances further up the trail at the piled basalt. Suddenly closing the distance between himself and the stones, Paisley appears to shoot up and over the pile with one, two, three big steps. Slamming his fists down to get purchase and clear stones all in one sweep, two sharp cones flit down from the sides of his pinkies and grab onto the chalky dirt, leaving two scratched grooves where Paisley's weight digs into the corner of the terrace. He lies there a moment holding himself with his bulging forearms, legs kicking behind him. Then pulls his armor-like body onto the side of the path, rolls into a cross-legged position, and gracefully lets his hands float onto his knees.

"Funny. Nice miss." Lyra loved to kid with Paisley, and he always felt that fuzzy memory on the edges of his cheeks when she did. So he likes to play it up sometimes.

The doorway has nearly lost all its inhabitant shards of basalt. The avalanche they caused pulled most of the remainder off the top terrace, and the escapee pushed the rest of it into the ante-tunnel. Soft bangs are heard echoing far into the dimness.

"Still up here. Trying to crumble its way out, no doubt."

Seth nods to Lyra. It still feels like they should be whispering, "I have an idea. We need to find where the water used to be running down here."

"It will lead us out?"

"It will lead us out of this chamber, is my hope. Whether it leads us to the ground is a question we'll have to answer when we do."

Paisley seems to agree and is already strolling slowly across the uneven floor of the limestone, using a narrow beam of UV light to scan his feet for impressions or patterns in the rock that would suggest a larger flow. Seth and Lyra switch off their headlamps and follow in the shadows.

From the opposite end of the arena cave, a pattern of small boulders rolling off a low shelf keeps sending soft, short-lived echoes through the space. Their neighbor does not notice them creeping around, or does not care about anything but getting out.

Seth almost walks into Paisley who has stopped in his tracks, his head pointed to the ground where the ends of two purple lasers are moving in slow lissajous patterns on the surface of what could have been smoothed-out chalcedony, rich with ripples and cleavages in different directions. When Paisley leans slightly forward, the lines looping in patterns change direction and angle sharply to one side before returning to their amoebic dance around each other. It's a clear change in energy within the rock.

"Oh look! Rock and crystals form a larger channel here, is what Paisley has found." Seth crouches, leans over the spot, touches the grain on top of the rock nearby. He twists awkwardly to speak, "Touching makes it obvious, the smoother erosion runs suddenly to the left, I think I can feel how low it... woah, I, OH AH FUCK!"

And then Seth is falling suddenly to the left.
